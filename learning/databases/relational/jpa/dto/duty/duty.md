# Duty separation
DTOs aggregate and package data from various sources, making it
easier to send and receive information.
They also support simple tasks like converting data to and from formats like JSON or
XML (serialization/deserialization) and performing basic data checks.
This lightweight handling ensures that complex business rules remain in the appropriate layers.
