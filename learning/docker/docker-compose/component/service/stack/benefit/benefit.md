# Benefits

- **automatic networking**: services within the same stack can communicate seamlessly using service names without needing manual network configuration;
- **simplified deployment**: all services in the stack can be deployed, managed, and updated using a single `docker-compose.yml` file or `docker stack deploy`;
- **dependency management**: services can be started in the correct order using `depends_on`, preventing connection failures and ensuring smooth operation;


- **shared volumes**: services can use named volumes to persist and share data, ensuring that databases and other stateful components retain information across restarts;
- **centralized environment variables**: configuration settings can be defined once and used across multiple services, reducing duplication and ensuring consistency;
- **scalability**: services can be easily scaled within the stack using `deploy.replicas` in Swarm mode or the `--scale` flag in Compose;


- **load balancing**: when running in Docker Swarm, multiple service instances can be automatically distributed across nodes for better performance and fault tolerance;
- **centralized logging**: logs from all services can be collected in a single location, making debugging and monitoring more efficient;
- **security and isolation**: services within the stack are isolated from external networks unless explicitly exposed, reducing security risks;


- **easier maintenance**: updates, restarts, and rollbacks can be managed collectively for all services in the stack, reducing operational complexity.
