# Scalability Limits

- may not scale well for large clusters or high-throughput services; 
- as the number of nodes or volume of traffic increases, the overhead of maintaining consistent routing state across all nodes can grow significantly;
- ingress network and proxy handling can become a bottleneck;
 

- the routing mesh relies on an internal load balancer and iptables rules that may introduce latency and consume CPU resources, especially under heavy traffic;
- incoming traffic to a published service can be received by any node in the swarm, regardless of where the actual container is running; 
- this can lead to inefficient routing, as the request might be forwarded internally to another node, adding latency and consuming additional network resources;
 

- this can lead to inefficient routing and increased network hops, affecting performance and resource usage;
- the encapsulation and encryption mechanisms used in overlay networks (like VXLAN) can further reduce throughput and increase packet latency, particularly in multi-host deployments;
- troubleshooting and monitoring network behavior can be more complex due to the abstraction added by the routing mesh, making it harder to pinpoint performance issues in large-scale environments.
