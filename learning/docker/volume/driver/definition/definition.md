# Driver Definition

- Docker volume drivers are plugins or mechanisms that define how volumes are created, managed, and stored in Docker; 
- by default, Docker uses the built-in [local](../type/local/local.md) driver, but it also supports other volume drivers, including third-party and cloud-based options.
