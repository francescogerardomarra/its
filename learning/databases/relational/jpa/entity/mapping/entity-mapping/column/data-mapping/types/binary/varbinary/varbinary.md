- it is because `VARBINARY` is a **variable-length binary string**;
- it only uses as much storage as 
needed for the actual string, plus
a small overhead to store the length of the string;
- the length of the sting is calculated in bytes;
- it is used for storing binary data which includes images and sound;
- it can also be used for cryptography.
