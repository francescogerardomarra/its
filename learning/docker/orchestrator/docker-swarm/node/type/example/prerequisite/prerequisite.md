# Prerequisites

- it's not possible to run this example locally, since you need 4 different machines (nodes);
- **this example is a good practice since**:
    - the manager nodes don't run the workloads (containers), they just manage the swarm cluster;
    - the worker nodes run the workloads.
- **you can use this architecture in production**.
