# Docker Compose Definition

- Docker Compose is a **tool** that simplifies the process of defining and running multi-container Docker applications;
- instead of managing multiple containers separately using the `docker run` command, Docker Compose allows you to configure them in a single YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`) and manage them with a single command.
