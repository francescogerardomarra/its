# Application
[Here](resources/src/webservicerest.zip), we have a working example of an application that demonstrates entity relationships, specifically showcasing a many-to-many relationship.

This example uses a different schema compared to the [previous example](../../../../spring/repository/repository.md), called `shop_schema`.

**Here is how to setup our example:**
- you can use the working example by first creating and populating the schema with our [guide](../db-build/db_build.md) and [build scripts](../db-build/resources/scripts/populate);
- as a second point, you should extract our [zip file](resources/src/webservicerest.zip) in a folder of choice, open it with intellij
and make it run;
- if it runs correctly, go ahead and use our [testing guide](../running/running.md) to see if it works.
