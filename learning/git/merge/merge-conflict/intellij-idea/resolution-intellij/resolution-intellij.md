# How can I resolve a merge conflict safely?

Resolving a merge conflict in IntelliJ IDEA is a straightforward process, thanks to its built-in Git integration and helpful conflict resolution tools. 

Here are the steps to resolve a merge conflict safely in IntelliJ IDEA:

1. **Open the Project**

   - Open your IntelliJ IDEA project that has a merge conflict.

2. **View the Conflicted Files**

    - In the Project view or the Git tool window, locate the files with merge conflicts. These files will have an "M" icon indicating the conflict.

3. **Open the Conflicted File**

    - Double-click on one of the conflicted files to open it in the editor. IntelliJ IDEA will display the file with conflict markers, similar to this:
```shell
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Code from your current branch
=======
// Code from the branch being merged
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

4. **Resolve the Conflict**

   - Manually edit the conflicted file to choose which changes to keep and which to discard. Remove the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) and modify the code as needed.

5. **Review the Changes**

    - IntelliJ IDEA provides a side-by-side view of the conflicting changes. You can see both the changes from your current branch and the incoming branch. Use this view to make informed decisions about conflict resolution.

6. **Use the Editor Toolbar**

    - IntelliJ IDEA offers a handy toolbar at the top of the editor window with buttons for conflict resolution. You can use these buttons to accept the changes from your branch (Accept Theirs) or the incoming branch (Accept Yours) for the current conflict.

7. **Manually Merge Changes**
    - If neither "Accept Theirs" nor "Accept Yours" completely resolves the conflict to your satisfaction, you can manually merge the changes by copying and pasting code from one side to the other as needed.

8. **Save the File**
    - After resolving the conflict, save the file (Ctrl + S or Cmd + S).

9. **Mark the Conflict as Resolved**

    - In the Project view or Git tool window, right-click on the resolved file and select "Mark as Resolved."

10. **Commit the Changes**
    - Once you've resolved all conflicts in your project, commit the changes. You can do this through IntelliJ IDEA's Git integration by opening the Commit tool window, reviewing the changes, and then committing with a commit message that describes the resolution.

11. **Continue Merging or Rebasing**

    - If you were in the middle of a merge or rebase operation when the conflict occurred, continue the operation as needed. IntelliJ IDEA will guide you through this process as well.

IntelliJ IDEA's Git integration provides a user-friendly and visual approach to resolving merge conflicts, making it easier to manage conflicts and ensure a safe resolution.
