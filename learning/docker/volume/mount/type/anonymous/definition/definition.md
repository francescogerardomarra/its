# Anonymous Volumes Definition

- an anonymous volume is a volume that Docker creates automatically without a name, when:
  - **you mount a volume to a container directory without specifying a volume name**.
- it is managed by Docker, but you didn’t give it a meaningful name yourself;
- it’s called "anonymous" because it gets a random, long unique ID as its name;


- **bind mounts cannot become anonymous volumes because specifying a host machine path always creates a bind mount directly, not a volume**.
