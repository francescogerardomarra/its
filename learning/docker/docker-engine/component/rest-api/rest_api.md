# REST API

- the Docker Engine REST API provides an interface for other tools and software to interact programmatically with the Docker Engine;
- it supports commands to manage containers, images, volumes, and networks without directly using the CLI;
- [Docker Daemon](../daemon/daemon.md) is the **server** exposing the REST API;


- [Docker CLI](../cli/cli.md) is the **client** that invokes the REST API.
