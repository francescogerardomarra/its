# Entity mapping
**Entity mapping has the following characteristics:**
- **it is the process of defining how Java classes (entities) correspond to database tables**;
- including how the class's fields map to the table's columns, and how relationships
between classes map to relationships between tables;
- **it is typically done using annotations** or XML configuration.
