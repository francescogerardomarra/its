# Why Use Volumes

Volumes are used for these reasons:

- **persist data** across container restarts or rebuilds (e.g., database files, user uploads);
- **share data** between multiple containers;
- **backup and migrate** container data easily;
 

- **performance**: volumes are faster and more efficient than [bind mounts](../mount/type/bind/definition/definition.md) on Linux.
