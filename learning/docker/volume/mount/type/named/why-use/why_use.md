# Why Use Them

- **persistence**: your data isn't tied to a container's life cycle;
- **portability**: you can easily move volumes between systems or services;
- **isolation**: containers can share or have exclusive access to volumes;


- **ease of backup/restore**: you can easily back up a volume separately.
