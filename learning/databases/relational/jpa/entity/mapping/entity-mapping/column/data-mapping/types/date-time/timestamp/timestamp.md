**`TIMESTAMP` has the following characteristics:**
- it is mapped to the `java.sql.Timestamp` class;
- it is because `TIMESTAMP` stores year,month,day,hour,minute and second values;
- it also stores fractional seconds which are not stored by the `DATE` data type;
- it is an extension of the [DATE](../date/date.md) data type.
- **this data type is supported by these technologies:**
    - MySQL
