# Containers and the Host OS Kernel

- containers share the same **kernel** as the host operating system;
- the kernel is the core part of an OS that manages system resources and hardware interaction;
- for example, if the host OS is Linux, all containers running on it must use the Linux kernel;
 

- you cannot run a Windows kernel inside a container on a Linux host, or vice versa.
