| **Definition**              | A Java object **managed by the Spring container**                        | A Java class that follows a specific naming and structure convention |
| **Purpose**                 | Used as a building block in Spring apps, with full framework integration | Used to encapsulate data, typically for reuse or serialization       |
| **Framework Dependency**    | Tied to Spring (needs Spring context to function as a bean)              | Plain Java, no dependency on any framework                           |
| **Lifecycle Management**    | Lifecycle (creation, init, destruction) is handled by Spring             | Lifecycle is manual or managed by JVM/other tools                    |
| **Configuration/Injection** | Supports annotations for injection/config (`@Autowired`, `@Value`, etc.) | No built-in support for configuration or DI                          |
| **Structure Rules**         | No strict rules â€” can be any class managed by Spring                     | Must have a no-arg constructor, getters/setters, and be serializable |
| **Use Case**                | Business logic, services, repositories, controllers, etc.                | Data transfer objects, config holders, etc.                          |

**Summary:**
- a Spring Bean is any Java object that is registered and managed by the Spring container, 
typically used for implementing business logic, handling requests, or managing data access;
- a JavaBean (POJO) is a standard Java class that follows specific naming conventions (e.g.,
private fields, public getters/setters, no-arg constructor), often used to represent structured data;
- the main difference is that Spring Beans are part of the Spring ecosystem, with lifecycle and
dependency management handled by the framework, while JavaBeans are just simple data carriers,
completely independent of any framework.
