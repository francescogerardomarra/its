Here's a comprehensive list of the most common `Dockerfile` commands that a developer will use throughout their career:

---

### **Base Image & FROM**
- `FROM <image>` â€“ Defines the base image for the build.
- `FROM <image>:<tag>` â€“ Uses a specific version of the base image.
- `FROM scratch` â€“ Starts with an empty base (used for minimal images like Go binaries).

---

### **Metadata**
- `LABEL <key>=<value>` â€“ Adds metadata to the image (e.g., author, version, description).

---

### **Environment Variables**
- `ENV <key>=<value>` â€“ Defines environment variables available inside the container.

---

### **Copy & Add Files**
- `COPY <src> <dest>` â€“ Copies files from the host machine into the image.
- `COPY ["<src1>", "<src2>", ..., "<dest>"]` â€“ Copies multiple files.
- `ADD <src> <dest>` â€“ Similar to COPY but can also handle remote URLs and tar archives.

---

### **Working Directory**
- `WORKDIR <path>` â€“ Sets the working directory for subsequent commands.

---

### **Run Commands**
- `RUN <command>` â€“ Executes commands inside the container during the build process.
- `RUN <command1> && <command2>` â€“ Chains multiple commands.
- `RUN ["executable", "param1", "param2"]` â€“ Alternative JSON array format.

---

### **User Management**
- `USER <username>` â€“ Sets the user for executing commands inside the container.

---

### **Exposing Ports**
- `EXPOSE <port>` â€“ Documents the port that the container will listen on.

---

### **Command Execution**
- `CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]` â€“ Default command to run inside the container.
- `CMD <command>` â€“ Shell form of CMD.
- `CMD ["sh", "-c", "echo Hello"]` â€“ Executes a shell command.

---

### **Entry Point**
- `ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]` â€“ Defines the main process for the container.
- `ENTRYPOINT ["sh", "-c", "exec myapp"]` â€“ Executes a shell script.

---

### **Arguments & Build-time Variables**
- `ARG <variable>` â€“ Defines a variable used only at build time.
- `ARG <variable>=<default>` â€“ Defines a default value.
- `ENV VAR_NAME ${ARG_NAME}` â€“ Uses an ARG in an ENV variable.

---

### **Health Check**
- `HEALTHCHECK --interval=<time> --timeout=<time> --retries=<num> CMD <command>` â€“ Defines a health check.
- `HEALTHCHECK NONE` â€“ Disables health checks.

---

### **Volume Management**
- `VOLUME ["/data"]` â€“ Creates a mount point for persistent storage.

---

### **Stopping Signals**
- `STOPSIGNAL <signal>` â€“ Defines the system signal for stopping the container (e.g., `STOPSIGNAL SIGTERM`).

---

### **Multistage Builds**
- `FROM <image> AS <name>` â€“ Defines a new build stage.
- `COPY --from=<name> <src> <dest>` â€“ Copies artifacts from one stage to another.

---

### **OnBuild Instructions**
- `ONBUILD <instruction>` â€“ Defines instructions to be executed in derived Dockerfiles.

---

### **Maintainer (Deprecated)**
