# Comparison

In this chapter, we see a comparison between private and public registries.

**Table:**

| **Feature**                     | **Private Registry**                                              | **Public Registry**                                                      |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Access Control**              | full control over user permissions and repository access.         | limited; public images are accessible by anyone.                         |
| **Security Policies**           | customizable security policies, including encryption and signing. | basic security features; limited to platform settings.                   |
| **Integration with Systems**    | integrates with organizational systems (e.g., LDAP, SSO, RBAC).   | no integration with internal systems.                                    |
| **Data Sensitivity**            | suitable for proprietary or sensitive images.                     | designed for open, community-shared images.                              |
| **Cost**                        | may involve infrastructure or subscription costs.                 | free for public images; private repositories may require a subscription. |
| **Scalability**                 | scalable based on organizational infrastructure or cloud service. | scalable but relies on the public platform's infrastructure.             |
| **Control over Infrastructure** | full control (self-hosted or managed in private cloud).           | no control over the underlying infrastructure.                           |
| **Use Case**                    | ideal for enterprises needing secure and private image storage.   | best for sharing open-source or widely-used images publicly.             |
