# Nodes Definition

- in Docker Swarm, nodes are the individual machines (physical or virtual) that participate in a Swarm cluster;
- each node runs the Docker Engine and communicates with other nodes to orchestrate container deployment;
- it's important that all the nodes in the same cluster are reachable from each other.
