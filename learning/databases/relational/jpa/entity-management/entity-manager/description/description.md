# Description
`EntityManager` is the main interface provided by the Java Persistence API (JPA) 
to interact with the database using Java objects.

**Think of it as the controller that allows you to:**
- Store (persist) new objects in the database
- Retrieve existing ones
- Update or merge changes
- Delete records

Itâ€™s essentially your gateway to persistence operations in JPA.
