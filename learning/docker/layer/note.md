Sure! Let's break down **everything a developer *must* know about Docker layers**, keeping it practical and relevant to your day-to-day work. I‚Äôll skip obscure details and focus on what matters for performance, debugging, and efficient development.

## üê≥ What are Docker Layers?

A **Docker image** is built up from a **series of layers**. Each instruction in a `Dockerfile` creates a new layer. Think of them like layers of a cake ‚Äì stacked one on top of the other.

---

## üìö Core Concepts You Must Know

### 1. **Layers Are Cached**
- Docker **caches each layer**.
- If you rebuild your image and nothing changed in a layer or before it ‚Äì Docker reuses the cached layer. Super fast.  
  ‚û§ But, **if one layer changes, all layers *after* it get rebuilt**.

  üß† Tip: Put frequently-changing parts (like `COPY . .`) **later** in your Dockerfile to maximize cache use.

---

### 2. **Layer Order Matters**
- The order of your instructions in the `Dockerfile` affects build time.
- Example:
```Dockerfile
# BAD
COPY . .
RUN npm install

# BETTER
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
```
This way, if your app code changes but `package.json` doesn‚Äôt, Docker can cache `npm install`.

---

### 3. **Each Layer Is Read-Only**
- Layers are **read-only**.
- When you run a container, Docker adds a **read-write layer** on top (called the container layer).
- Changes made during runtime (writing logs, modifying files) happen there, and disappear when the container is deleted.

---

### 4. **Minimize Layers**
- Combine commands where possible to reduce layer count and image size:
```Dockerfile
# Instead of:
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y curl

# Do this:
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
```

---

### 5. **Each Layer Adds Size**
- Every layer contributes to the final image size.
- Clean up in the same layer to avoid bloating:
```Dockerfile
# YES:
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# NO:
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
RUN rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

---

### 6. **Use `.dockerignore`**
- Like `.gitignore`, but for Docker builds.
- Prevents unnecessary files (e.g., `node_modules`, `.git`, logs) from being copied and creating unwanted layers.

---

### 7. **Multistage Builds** (Advanced but Common)
Even though you asked to skip uncommon stuff, this one is very **common and useful**:

Build in one stage, copy the final result to a clean image:
```Dockerfile
FROM node:18 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install && npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
```

‚û°Ô∏è Result: Small production image, no dev tools, faster deploys.
