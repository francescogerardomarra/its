# Swarm Mode Definition

- Docker Swarm mode is a native clustering and orchestration feature built into Docker that allows you to manage a cluster of Docker engines (called a swarm) as a single virtual system;
- this mode transforms how Docker operates by enabling distributed container deployment, scaling, and management across multiple machines.
