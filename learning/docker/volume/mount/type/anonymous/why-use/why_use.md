# Why Use Them (and Why Prefer Named Volumes)

- some Dockerfiles (images) have a `VOLUME` instruction:

    ```commandline
    VOLUME /var/lib/mysql
    ```

- when you run a container from that image, Docker automatically creates an anonymous volume if you don't specify anything for `/var/lib/mysql`.

**Why prefer named volumes over anonymous volumes:**
- **easier management**: named volumes are easy to find, list, and inspect using their given name;
- **reusability**: you can attach the same named volume to multiple containers easily;
- **better organization**: clear names help you understand what data each volume stores;


- **simpler backups and restores**: named volumes make it easier to back up and restore specific data;
- **more predictable deployments**: you can configure infrastructure (`docker-compose.yml`, scripts) knowing exactly which volume will be used;
- **clearer maintenance**: it's much easier to clean up unused volumes when you know their purpose by name;
 

- **supports long-lived services**: ideal for databases, application data, logs, and other services where persistence is critical;
- **improved readability**: configuration files (like `docker-compose.yml`) become much easier to understand when volumes have meaningful names;
- **avoids system clutter**: reduces the number of random anonymous volumes that could accumulate and waste disk space.
