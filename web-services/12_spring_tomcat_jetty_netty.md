# Spring Boot vs Spring WebFlux: Tomcat, Jetty, and Netty

This document explores the differences between the server models used by Spring Boot (Tomcat, Jetty) and Spring WebFlux (Netty). It also delves into the concepts of blocking and non-blocking models, thread management in each, and their respective advantages and disadvantages.

## Tomcat and Jetty in Spring Boot

### What They Are
- **Tomcat** and **Jetty** are servlet containers used by Spring Boot for handling HTTP requests. They are based on the traditional thread-per-request model.
- Both are designed for synchronous, blocking communication and implement the Java Servlet API.

### Characteristics
- **Blocking I/O:**
  - Each request is assigned a dedicated thread.
  - Threads remain blocked while waiting for responses (e.g. from a database or external API).
- **Thread Management:**
  - A fixed number of threads in the thread pool handle incoming requests.
  - If all threads are busy, subsequent requests are queued.

### Use Case
- Best suited for synchronous applications with moderate traffic.
- Example: A traditional web application with server-side rendering.

## Netty in Spring WebFlux

### What It Is
- **Netty** is an asynchronous, event-driven networking library used by Spring WebFlux.
- It operates in a non-blocking fashion, supporting reactive programming.

### Characteristics
- **Non-Blocking I/O:**
  - Threads are not blocked while waiting for operations to complete.
  - Instead, tasks are registered as events and executed asynchronously.
- **Thread Management:**
  - A small number of threads (event loops) handle a large number of requests concurrently.

### Use Case
- Ideal for high-concurrency applications, such as streaming services or real-time systems.
- Example: A chat application with thousands of concurrent users.

## Blocking vs Non-Blocking Models

### Blocking (e.g. Tomcat, Jetty)
- A request is assigned a thread that performs all the required operations sequentially.
- If the thread needs to wait (e.g. for database queries), it remains idle, consuming system resources.

#### Example
1. A user sends a request to fetch data.
2. The server assigns a thread to handle the request.
3. The thread waits (blocks) until the database responds.
4. The response is sent back, and the thread becomes free for the next request.

#### Thread Behavior
- **Main Thread:**
  - Handles incoming requests and assigns them to worker threads.
- **Worker Threads:**
  - Perform the actual work (I/O operations, computations).
  - One thread per request.

#### Advantages
- Simpler programming model.
- Easier to debug and monitor.

#### Disadvantages
- Limited scalability due to thread exhaustion.
- Higher memory consumption (each thread requires stack memory).

---

### Non-Blocking (e.g. Netty)
- Tasks are executed asynchronously. Instead of waiting, threads register callbacks or events to handle responses.
- The same thread can process multiple tasks concurrently.

#### Example
1. A user sends a request to fetch data.
2. The server assigns the task to an event loop thread.
3. The thread sends the database query and registers a callback.
4. Meanwhile, the thread handles other requests.
5. When the database responds, the callback executes and sends the response to the user.

#### Thread Behavior
- **Main Thread:**
  - Handles event loops and task coordination.
- **Event Loop Threads:**
  - Handle multiple tasks asynchronously.

#### Advantages
- High scalability with minimal threads.
- Better resource utilization, especially under high concurrency.

#### Disadvantages
- Complex programming model.
- Debugging can be more challenging due to asynchronous flows.

## Why Non-Blocking Is Useful
- **Scalability:**
  - A non-blocking server can handle thousands of concurrent connections using fewer threads.
- **Performance:**
  - Reduces thread contention and overhead from thread context switching.
- **Real-Time Applications:**
  - Suitable for systems requiring low latency and high throughput.

## Comparison of Thread Models

| Aspect                  | Blocking (Tomcat/Jetty)      | Non-Blocking (Netty)                 |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Concurrency Model**   | Thread-per-request           | Event-loop based                     |
| **Thread Usage**        | One thread per request       | Single thread handles multiple tasks |
| **Scalability**         | Limited by thread pool size  | High, limited by CPU resources       |
| **Latency**             | Higher due to blocking waits | Lower due to asynchronous processing |
| **Ease of Development** | Easier (sequential flow)     | More complex (callbacks, events)     |

## When to Use Each Model

### Use Blocking (Tomcat, Jetty):
- Applications with low to moderate traffic.
- Simpler APIs where blocking behavior is acceptable.
- Scenarios where ease of development is a priority.

### Use Non-Blocking (Netty):
- High-concurrency systems with heavy traffic.
- Real-time or event-driven applications.
- Applications with long wait times for external services.

By understanding the differences between blocking and non-blocking models, developers can make informed decisions about which technology to use for their specific application requirements.
