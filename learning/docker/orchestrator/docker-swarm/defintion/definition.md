# Docker Swarm Definition

- Docker Swarm is Docker's native clustering and orchestration tool;
- **it's designed to manage and deploy multi-container applications across a cluster of machines**;
- it allows you to turn a pool of Docker hosts into a single, virtual Docker engine;


- think of it like Kubernetes, but simpler and built into Docker.
