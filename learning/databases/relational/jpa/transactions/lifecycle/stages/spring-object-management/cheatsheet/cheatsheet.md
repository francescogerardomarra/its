**Here is a list of some of the most important Spring annotations and what they do:**
- `@Service, @Repository, @Controller`: specializations of `@Component` for specific use cases.
- `@Configuration`: indicates a configuration class (provides beans).
- `@Bean`: declares a bean in a `@Configuration` class.
