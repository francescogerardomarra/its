# Introduction

- a **volume** is a storage mechanism **managed by Docker** to **persist data** outside of containers;
- without volumes, when you stop or remove a container, **everything inside it is lost** (except the image);
- volumes **keep data safe**, even if containers are destroyed or updated.
