# Architecture

**Docker:**
- uses **containers** which share the host operating system kernel;
- containers run as isolated processes in user space;
- lightweight and efficient.

**VMs:**
- uses a **hypervisor** to virtualize hardware and run multiple guest operating systems;
- each VM includes a full OS, which makes them larger and more resource-intensive.
