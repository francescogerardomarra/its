# Replicas without Docker Swarm Definition

- **no built-in load balancing**: Docker Compose does not automatically distribute traffic across replicas, requiring an external reverse proxy like Nginx or Traefik;
- **port conflicts**: multiple replicas of a service cannot share the same host port, making it necessary to use dynamically assigned ports or a reverse proxy;
- **no service discovery**: each replica gets a unique container name instead of sharing a single service name, making direct inter-container communication more complex;
 

- **stateful services issues**: databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL do not natively support multiple replicas without additional replication and clustering configurations;
- **manual scaling**: scaling up or down requires running `docker-compose up --scale`, as Compose does not dynamically adjust replicas based on demand;
- **lack of high availability**: if a container crashes, Compose does not automatically restart another replica on a different node, but on the same node, unlike Swarm or Kubernetes;
 

- **networking limitations**: Compose does not provide advanced networking features like overlay networks, which are required for distributed multi-host deployments;
- **no rolling updates**: updating services requires manually stopping and restarting containers, which can cause downtime without a load balancer;
- **not ideal for production**: Compose is primarily designed for local development and lacks the orchestration capabilities needed for managing large-scale production environments.
