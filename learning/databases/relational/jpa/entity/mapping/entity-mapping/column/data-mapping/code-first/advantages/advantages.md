# Advantages
- **domain-driven design**:
    - encourages modeling based on the application's  
      business logic, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code.
- **flexibility and control**:
    - gives developers full control over entity classes  
      and relationships, without relying on a pre-defined schema.
- **evolutionary schema development**:
    - allows incremental changes to the database schema  
      through code changes and migrations.
- **version control**:
    - schema changes can be tracked and managed  
      through source control along with the application code.
