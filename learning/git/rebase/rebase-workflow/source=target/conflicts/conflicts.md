# Case 3 (no fast-forward, conflicts)
Rebasing against the origin with conflicts involves resolving any conflicts that arise during the rebase process.

**Here's an example:**

Suppose you have a local branch named `feature-branch` and you want to rebase it against the `origin/main` branch.

1. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository**
```shell
git fetch origin
```
2. **Switch to your feature branch**
```shell
git checkout feature-branch
```
3. **Rebase your feature branch against the origin/main branch**
```shell
git rebase --no-ff origin/main
```
The `--no-ff` flag ensures that Git creates a new commit for the rebase, even if it could perform a fast-forward.

If there are conflicts, Git will pause the rebase process and inform you about the conflicts.

4. **If conflicts occur:**
- Git will stop at the first commit with a conflict.
- Use git status to see which files have conflicts.
- Open the conflicting files, resolve the conflicts, and save the changes.
- After resolving conflicts, stage the changes:
```shell
git add <conflicted-file>
```
- Continue the rebase with:
```shell
git rebase --continue
```
The `--continue` flag tells Git to proceed with the rebase after resolving conflicts.

5. **If you want to abort the rebase at any point**
```shell
git rebase --abort
```
6. **After successfully resolving conflicts, complete the rebase**

```shell
git rebase --continue
```
If there are multiple conflicts, Git will stop at each one until you resolve them all. 

Keep repeating the conflict resolution and git rebase `--continue` until the rebase is complete.

7. **After a successful rebase, push your changes to the remote repository**
```shell
git push origin feature-branch
```
Since you've rewritten the commit history, you'll need to force-push if the branch has already been 
pushed to the remote. 

Use with caution, especially in a collaborative environment.

Remember to communicate with your team if you're force-pushing or making significant changes to shared branches,
as this can affect others who are working on the same branch.
