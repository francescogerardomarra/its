# Mounts Introduction

In Docker, there are three types of mechanisms to persist and share data: 
- **bind mounts** (link a specific host path to the container);
- **named volumes** (Docker managed storage with a given name);
- **anonymous volumes** (temporary, unnamed storage created automatically by Docker).
