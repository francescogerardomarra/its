# Harbor

- Harbor is an **open-source container registry** that extends the capabilities of a basic Docker registry;
- it is particularly useful for organizations that prioritize security, scalability, and advanced management of container images;
- Harbor offers:

  - **vulnerability scanning**: automatically scans container images for known vulnerabilities and provides detailed reports to improve security;
  - **image replication**: allows users to replicate images between multiple Harbor instances or external registries, ensuring redundancy and improved availability;
  - **role-based access control**: lets administrators define and enforce permissions, ensuring that only authorized users or teams can access specific images or perform certain actions.


- Harbor is widely used by organizations aiming to maintain strict control over their containerized environments while enhancing security and compliance.
