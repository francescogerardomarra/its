# Use Case

- letâ€™s say you're running a web application that gets lots of traffic;
- using a replicated service, you can run multiple copies (replicas) of your app behind a load balancer to:
  - handle more requests;
  - increase fault tolerance (if one instance crashes, others are still running).
