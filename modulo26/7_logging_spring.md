# Logging in Springboot

## Default Setup
Spring Boot provides a powerful yet simple default logging configuration. Out of the box, it sets up everything you need to get started with logging using industry-standard tools.

üîß 1. Overview of the Default Logging Setup
--------------------------------------------------

Spring Boot:

- **Uses Apache Commons Logging (JCL) as a logging facade.**
    - JCL (Jakarta Commons Logging) is **not a logging framework itself**, but a *facade* or *abstraction layer* for various logging frameworks. It's designed to allow the actual logging implementation to be plugged in at runtime.
    - This pattern is known as the **Facade Design Pattern**, which provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. This way, JCL decouples application code from specific logging implementations.

- **Internally, it routes log calls to SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java).**
    - SLF4J is another logging facade (more modern and flexible than JCL) that provides a clean and consistent API to developers.
    - SLF4J bridges the logging calls to the actual implementation (such as Logback).
    - When Spring Boot starts, it includes the necessary SLF4J bridges to route JCL calls to SLF4J automatically.

- **The default implementation behind the scenes is Logback.**
    - Logback is a powerful and flexible logging framework authored by the same creator of Log4j.
    - It is the default logging backend used by SLF4J when running a Spring Boot application.

This setup provides:

- A clean API (`org.slf4j.Logger`) for developers.
- Structured, performant, and extensible logging behavior via Logback.
- No configuration required to start using it.

üöÄ 2. Getting Started
-------------------------------------------------------

When you create a Spring Boot project (e.g., using Spring Initializr or your favorite build tool), you don't need to add any logging dependencies manually‚Äîthey come pre-configured!

You can start logging like this:

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyService {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyService.class);

    public void performTask() {
        logger.info("Performing task...");
        logger.debug("Detailed debug info");
        logger.warn("A warning message");
        logger.error("Something went wrong!");
    }
}
```

üîç **Explanation:**

- `LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyService.class)`:
    - This is a **factory method** provided by SLF4J to create a logger instance.
    - It takes a `Class` as an argument and returns a logger associated with that class.
    - This association helps the logging framework identify where the log message originated.
    - Under the hood, SLF4J delegates the actual logging to the bound implementation (Logback by default).

- You can use different logging levels:
    - `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`

üì¶ 3. Where the Logs Go
-------------------------------

By default, Spring Boot logs:

- To the **console**
- Using a **color-coded pattern** (when supported by the terminal)
- With **log level set to INFO**

Default output looks like:

```
2025-04-15T14:20:32.487  INFO 12345 --- [  restartedMain] c.e.demo.MyService       : Performing task...
```

Output format:

```
timestamp log-level process-id --- [thread-name] logger-name : message
```

üìÅ 4. No Configuration Needed ‚Äî But You Can Add One
---------------------------------------------------------

Spring Boot auto-configures Logback using a default `logback.xml` under the hood. But if you want to override it:

- Create your own `logback-spring.xml` in `src/main/resources`
- Or customize via `application.properties`

We‚Äôll explore that later ‚Äî for now, just know you don‚Äôt need to configure anything to start logging.

‚úÖ Quick Recap
----------------

| Feature                           | Value                      |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Logging Facade                    | Apache Commons Logging     |
| Underlying Logging Implementation | Logback                    |
| Developer API                     | SLF4J (`org.slf4j.Logger`) |
| Configuration Needed?             | ‚ùå None                     |
| Logging Output                    | Console (default)          |

## Log levels
In this section, we'll cover how to configure logging levels in Spring Boot using `application.properties`.

Spring Boot (via SLF4J and Logback) supports the following standard log levels:

| Level | Description                                                                |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TRACE | Most detailed information ‚Äî typically only useful for diagnosing problems. |
| DEBUG | Useful for debugging and internal system details.                          |
| INFO  | General application flow and important runtime events. *(Default)*         |
| WARN  | Something unexpected happened, but the application can still continue.     |
| ERROR | Serious issues where part of the application might not be working.         |

These levels are hierarchical:

> If a logger is set to `INFO`, then `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR` messages will be shown ‚Äî but not `DEBUG` or `TRACE`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Logging Levels in `application.properties`
You can change the log level globally or for specific packages/classes using the `logging.level` property.

#### ‚úÖ Global Log Level
To set a global (root) log level:

```properties
# application.properties
logging.level.root=INFO
```

This sets the default level for all loggers in the application.

#### üéØ Per-Package Logging
To enable more detailed logging for a specific package:

```properties
# application.properties
logging.level.com.example.myapp=DEBUG
```

Or for a specific class:

```properties
logging.level.com.example.myapp.service.UserService=TRACE
```

You can configure multiple loggers like this:

```properties
logging.level.root=WARN
logging.level.com.example=INFO
logging.level.com.example.myapp=DEBUG
logging.level.com.example.myapp.repository=TRACE
```

This allows fine-grained control ‚Äî e.g., verbose logs during development but only for specific modules.

### üß™ Example in Action
Suppose you have this code in your `UserService` class:

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class UserService {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(UserService.class);

    public void createUser(String username) {
        logger.trace("Trace: Creating user {}", username);
        logger.debug("Debug: Creating user {}", username);
        logger.info("Info: Creating user {}", username);
        logger.warn("Warning: Creating user {}", username);
        logger.error("Error: Failed to create user {}", username);
    }
}
```

And you configure the properties file like:

```properties
logging.level.com.example.myapp.service.UserService=DEBUG
```

**Output:**
You will see:
- `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR`

You will not see:
- `TRACE` (because it's lower than the configured level)

If you change it to:

```properties
logging.level.com.example.myapp.service.UserService=TRACE
```

Then all logs, including `TRACE`, will be shown.

---

### üìÅ Using `application.yml` Instead?
Here‚Äôs the same config in `application.yml`:

```yaml
logging:
  level:
    root: WARN
    com.example.myapp: DEBUG
    com.example.myapp.service.UserService: TRACE
```

### üß† Pro Tip

You can also use environment-specific config files:

- `application-dev.properties`
- `application-prod.properties`

And then activate the profile via:

```properties
spring.profiles.active=dev
```

So in development, you can log everything, while production remains clean.

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Property                                  | Meaning                           |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `logging.level.root=INFO`                 | Sets default logging level        |
| `logging.level.com.example=DEBUG`         | Sets log level for package        |
| `logging.level.com.example.MyClass=TRACE` | Sets log level for specific class |

This flexibility gives you control over your log output, which is essential for debugging and performance.

## Customizing Log Output Format

In this section, we'll explore how to customize the format of your log messages as they appear in the **console output**.

This allows you to make logs more readable, structured, or adapted to your organization's standards ‚Äî all without touching any external configuration files like `logback.xml`.

### üñ®Ô∏è What Does the Default Console Log Look Like?
Spring Boot‚Äôs default console log format looks like this:

```
2025-04-15T16:00:45.351  INFO 31708 --- [  restartedMain] com.example.demo.MyService : Performing task...
```

### üîç Components:
- **Timestamp**: ISO-8601 style with milliseconds
- **Log Level**: e.g., INFO, DEBUG
- **PID**: Process ID
- **Thread**: Which thread generated the log
- **Logger**: Class name
- **Message**: Your custom log message

This is useful ‚Äî but you might want a simpler or differently structured format.

### üõ†Ô∏è Customizing the Console Log Format
Spring Boot allows you to customize the log pattern using the property:

```properties
logging.pattern.console
```

This property controls how log messages appear **in the console only**.

### ü§î What Does "Console" Mean Here?
The word **"console"** refers to the **standard output stream** of the application ‚Äî typically your terminal, command line interface, or the output panel in your IDE where the logs are printed during application runtime.

The term "console" comes from the days of command-line interfaces and system terminals. It traditionally represents the text-based interface where a program outputs messages.

In Spring Boot (and underlying Logback):
- `console` is **not a reserved keyword** in the sense that you create or name an appender called "console" manually.
- However, **Spring Boot preconfigures a `ConsoleAppender`** under the hood as part of its default logging setup.
- The property `logging.pattern.console` is a **convenient shortcut** provided by Spring Boot to customize the layout of that built-in `ConsoleAppender`.

You **cannot rename** or alias this internal identifier (like calling it `terminal` or `stdoutAppender`). The configuration key **must be**:

```properties
logging.pattern.console
```

This is a **Spring Boot convention** ‚Äî and while the appender itself is not explicitly named in your code, this property will always point to the log pattern used for console output.

> üìå TL;DR: You can't change the name `console` in `logging.pattern.console` ‚Äî it's a Spring Boot convention tied to the default ConsoleAppender. It's not a general-purpose label you can rename.

### üß© Common Pattern Placeholders
| Pattern               | Description                                              |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `%d{pattern}`         | Timestamp in custom format (e.g., `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`) |
| `%thread`             | Thread name                                              |
| `%level` / `%-5level` | Log level, optionally padded (e.g. `INFO`)               |
| `%logger`             | Fully qualified logger (class) name                      |
| `%logger{36}`         | Logger name, truncated to 36 characters                  |
| `%msg`                | The actual log message                                   |
| `%n`                  | Newline                                                  |
| `%M`                  | Method name (expensive; use with caution)                |
| `%line`               | Line number (also expensive)                             |

You can mix and match these to create the exact format you want.

### üß™ Example 1: Simplified Log Format
```properties
logging.pattern.console=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n
```

Sample Output:
```
2025-04-15 16:10:00 [main] INFO  com.example.demo.MyService - Performing task...
```
‚úÖ This format is clean and easier to scan visually.

### üß™ Example 2: Developer-Friendly Verbose Format
```properties
logging.pattern.console=%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{20}.%M(%line) - %msg%n
```

Sample Output:
```
16:12:45.123 [main] INFO  MyService.createUser(27) - Creating user john_doe
```
üß† Includes class, method, and line number ‚Äî great for debugging, but adds overhead.

### üß™ Example 3: Minimalist Format for Production
```properties
logging.pattern.console=%d{HH:mm:ss} %-5level - %msg%n
```

Sample Output:
```
16:13:01 INFO  - User created successfully
```
‚úÖ This format strips out class and thread info ‚Äî ideal for lightweight, readable logs in production.

### üîÑ Can You Change the Pattern at Runtime?
No ‚Äî changes to `logging.pattern.console` require an application restart. It's part of the logging system initialization process.

### üîÅ Switching Back to Default
To revert to the default Spring Boot pattern, just remove or comment out the property:
```properties
# logging.pattern.console=...
```

Or use the default Logback pattern (not officially documented, but roughly equivalent to):
```properties
logging.pattern.console=%d{yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX} %5p [%t] --- %c{1}: %m%n
```

### ‚úÖ Summary
| Property                                | Description                                       |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `logging.pattern.console`               | Customizes how logs appear in the console         |
| `%d`, `%level`, `%thread`, `%msg`, etc. | Common placeholders in log patterns               |
| **Scope**                               | Works with **console output only**, not file logs |
| **"console" identifier**                | Spring Boot convention (cannot be renamed)        |

## Custom Log File Output
Spring Boot doesn‚Äôt just give you great console logging ‚Äî it also makes it very easy to write logs to a file, and to control exactly how those logs are formatted.

Whether you're debugging locally or sending logs to a centralized logging system (like ELK, Splunk, or Fluentd), you‚Äôll often want log files with clean, structured, and readable entries.

### üìÅ 1. Enable File Logging (Custom File Destination)

#### ‚úÖ Option A: `logging.file.name`
This writes logs to a specific file name, in the working directory by default:

```properties
logging.file.name=logs/myapp.log
```
This will create a file called `myapp.log` in the `./logs/` directory.

Spring Boot will **create the file and the directory if they don‚Äôt exist**.

Use this when you want full control over the filename.

#### ‚úÖ Option B: `logging.file.path`
This writes logs to the default file name (`spring.log`) in a custom directory:

```properties
logging.file.path=/var/logs/myapp
```
Output file: `/var/logs/myapp/spring.log`

Use this when you want control over the folder, but filename doesn‚Äôt matter.

> ‚õëÔ∏è **Important**: Don‚Äôt use `logging.file.name` and `logging.file.path` at the same time‚ÄîSpring Boot will **ignore** `logging.file.path` if both are defined.

### üé® 2. Customize the File Log Output Format

By default, file logs have the same format as console logs ‚Äî but you can customize them independently using:

```properties
logging.pattern.file
```
This property controls the format of the **file logs only**, and is separate from `logging.pattern.console`.

#### üß™ What Does "file" Mean in `logging.pattern.file`?

The word **"file"** here refers to the **FileAppender** that Spring Boot automatically configures when you enable file logging.

- You don't explicitly define or name the appender as "file" ‚Äî Spring Boot handles it internally.
- The `logging.pattern.file` property is a **Spring Boot convention**, which targets the default FileAppender.
- You **must use** the exact key `logging.pattern.file`; it's not possible to rename it (e.g., to `logging.pattern.logs` or `logging.pattern.disk`).

> üìå TL;DR: The `file` in `logging.pattern.file` refers to the internal FileAppender. The name is **not configurable**, and this property must use `file` as defined by Spring Boot.

### üß™ Example 1: Clean and Structured Log File
```properties
logging.file.name=logs/myapp.log
logging.pattern.file=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n
```

Sample Output (in `myapp.log`):
```
2025-04-15 16:42:03.125 [main] INFO  com.example.myapp.UserService - User created: john_doe
2025-04-15 16:42:03.130 [main] DEBUG com.example.myapp.UserService - User metadata: {email: john@example.com}
```
Readable, timestamped, and shows the source class.

### üß™ Example 2: Production-Friendly Minimal Format
```properties
logging.file.name=logs/myapp.log
logging.pattern.file=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5level - %msg%n
```

Output:
```
2025-04-15 16:45:12 INFO  - Scheduled job started
2025-04-15 16:45:13 WARN  - Disk usage nearing limit
```
Simple, short, easy to parse with log monitoring tools.

### üß™ Example 3: Verbose Developer Format (with method + line number)
```properties
logging.file.name=logs/myapp.log
logging.pattern.file=%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36}.%M(%line) - %msg%n
```

Output:
```
16:46:01.142 [main] INFO  UserService.createUser(27) - User created successfully
```
üî• Super helpful during development. Method names and line numbers can slow performance slightly ‚Äî avoid in production.

### üóã Common File Pattern Placeholders (Quick Ref)
| Pattern       | Meaning                           |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| `%d{...}`     | Timestamp (with custom format)    |
| `%thread`     | Thread name                       |
| `%level`      | Log level (INFO, DEBUG, etc.)     |
| `%logger{36}` | Logger (class) name, max 36 chars |
| `%M`          | Method name                       |
| `%line`       | Source code line number           |
| `%msg`        | Log message                       |
| `%n`          | Newline                           |

### üîê File Permissions and Deployment Notes
Ensure your Spring Boot application has **write permissions** to the directory where logs or other files will be stored.

In a **Linux environment**, the app runs under the **current Linux user** who starts the process, regardless of how it's launched:

- If run via `java -jar` from the terminal, it uses your current shell user (e.g., `ubuntu`)
- If launched from IntelliJ, it uses the logged-in user's account
- If started as a systemd service, it may use a specific service account like `springapp`

That user needs permission to:
- **Create** the log file (if it doesn't already exist)
- **Write** to the log file
- **Write into** the containing directory

Otherwise, logging (and potentially other file operations) will fail, possibly triggering an error like:

```bash
java.io.FileNotFoundException: /opt/myapp/logs/app.log (Permission denied)
```

To enable logging to `/opt/myapp/logs/app.log` for a user like `ubuntu` you need to set proper permissions like this:

```bash
# 1. Create the logs directory
sudo mkdir -p /opt/myapp/logs

# 2. Assign ownership to the Linux user
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /opt/myapp/logs

# 3. Set appropriate permissions
sudo chmod 755 /opt/myapp/logs
```

To confirm your current Linux user, run:
```bash
whoami
```
Use this username when setting ownership with `chown`.

Always use **absolute paths** for logging in production. Relative paths (e.g., `logs/app.log`) can break depending on how the app is launched.

Example for `application.properties`:
```properties
logging.file.name=/opt/myapp/logs/api.log
```

| Task                      | Command / Action                                     |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Identify your Linux user  | `whoami`                                             |
| Create log directory      | `mkdir -p /opt/myapp/logs`                           |
| Set directory ownership   | `chown -R <your-user>:<your-user> /opt/myapp/logs`   |
| Set write permissions     | `chmod 755 /opt/myapp/logs`                          |
| Define user for systemd   | `User=springapp` (or user that owns the directory)   |
| Use absolute logging path | `logging.file.name=/opt/myapp/logs/api.log`          |
| For Docker apps           | Mount volumes and verify container user write access |

### üåç Bonus: Different Logs for Different Profiles (Dev/Prod)
Use Spring profiles to define different logging setups.

**application-dev.properties**:
```properties
logging.file.name=logs/dev.log
logging.level.root=DEBUG
logging.pattern.file=%d{HH:mm:ss} %-5level %logger - %msg%n
```

**application-prod.properties**:
```properties
logging.file.name=/var/log/myapp/prod.log
logging.level.root=INFO
logging.pattern.file=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5level %logger - %msg%n
```

## Coding example
Spring Boot comes with built-in logging support via SLF4J and Logback. In most cases, **you do not need to add any extra Maven dependencies** because `spring-boot-starter` includes `spring-boot-starter-logging` by default. This makes it easy to get started with logging without worrying about configuration setup.

### 1. No Extra Dependencies Required
By default, Spring Boot includes SLF4J and Logback:
```xml
<!-- No need to include manually -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### 2. Logging Configuration in `application.properties`
```properties
# Global logging level
logging.level.root=INFO

# Logging level for your specific package
logging.level.com.example.loggingdemo=DEBUG

# Format for console output
logging.pattern.console=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - %logger{36} - %msg%n

# File logging
logging.file.name=logs/app.log
logging.file.max-size=10MB
logging.file.total-size-cap=100MB
logging.logback.rollingpolicy.max-history=10
```

### 3. Controller with Logging
```java
package com.example.loggingdemo.controller;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class SampleController {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SampleController.class);

    @GetMapping("/greet")
    public String greet() {
        logger.info("Handling /greet request");
        logger.debug("Returning greeting message");
        return "Hello from the controller!";
    }
}
```

### 4. Service with Logging
```java
package com.example.loggingdemo.service;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class SampleService {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SampleService.class);

    public String getServiceMessage() {
        logger.info("Executing service logic");
        logger.debug("Returning service message");
        return "Hello from the service!";
    }
}
```

### 5. Profile-specific Configuration (e.g., `application-dev.properties`)
