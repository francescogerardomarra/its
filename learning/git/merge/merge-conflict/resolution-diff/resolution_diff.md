# How can Git's `diff` command help in resolving merge conflicts?

**The git `diff` command is a powerful tool in Git that helps you understand the differences between various versions of files in your repository.**

``NOTE: essentially the git diff command is an extremely useful tool for the manual resolution of merge conflicts.``

When it comes to resolving merge conflicts, git `diff` can be invaluable in identifying and visualizing the conflicting changes.

Here is a guide on how to use the git diff command to resolve a merge conflict manually:

1. **Viewing Un-staged Changes**

    - Before committing any changes that resulted from a merge conflict resolution, you can use git `diff` to see the differences between your working directory and the previous commit (usually the state before the conflict).
   
```shell
git diff
```

This shows you the changes that are currently un-staged in your working directory, including any conflict markers that may still be present.

2. **Comparing Branches**

    - To view the differences between two branches, which can be helpful when resolving conflicts, you can use git `diff` with branch references. For example, to compare the current branch with the main branch:
   
```shell
git diff main..your-branch
```

This command will show you the differences between your branch and the main branch, including any conflicting changes.

3. **Applying Manual Changes**

   - After reviewing the differences using git `diff`, you can manually edit the conflicted file(s) to choose which changes to keep and which to discard. Remove the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) and modify the code as needed.

4. **Staging Changes**

    - Once you have resolved the conflicts in the file, you need to stage the changes using git add to mark them as resolved.

```shell
git add path/to/conflicted/file
```

5. **Committing Changes**

    - After staging all the resolved files, you can commit the changes to complete the merge conflict resolution.

```shell
git commit
```

By using git `diff` in conjunction with manual conflict resolution, you can get a clear view of the conflicting changes, understand what needs to be addressed, and ensure that the final merged code is in the desired state. It's a valuable tool in the process of resolving merge conflicts and ensuring a smooth and successful merge.
