# What is the `ours` and `theirs` strategy when resolving merge conflicts?

When resolving merge conflicts in Git, the terms `ours` and `theirs` refer to the branches involved in the conflict and help you specify which version of the code to keep. These terms are used as options with Git commands like git checkout, git merge, and git rebase. Here's what they mean:

- **Ours:** When you refer to `ours`, you are referring to the code from the branch you are currently on. In other words, it represents the version of the code that is currently checked out in your working directory.
- **Theirs:** Conversely, when you refer to `theirs`, you are referring to the code from the branch that you are merging or rebasing into your current branch. It represents the changes from the branch you are trying to merge or rebase.

The `ours` and `theirs` strategy is particularly useful when you have a merge conflict, and you need to specify which changes to keep when manually resolving the conflict.

For example, if you are in the middle of resolving a merge conflict, you can use these strategies as follows:

1. **Keep `Ours` (Current Branch)**

    - If you want to keep the changes from your current branch (the branch you are on), you can use the `ours` strategy to accept those changes while discarding the changes from the branch being merged.

```shell
git checkout --ours path/to/conflicted-file
```

2. **Keep `Theirs` (Incoming Branch)**

    - Conversely, if you want to keep the changes from the branch being merged (the incoming branch) and discard your current branch's changes for the conflicted file, you can use the `theirs` strategy.

```shell
git checkout --theirs path/to/conflicted-file
```

This command replaces the conflicted file with the version from the branch being merged.

After using either the `ours` or `theirs` strategy to resolve the conflict for a specific file, you should stage and commit the resolved changes as needed.

**Keep in mind that using `ours` or `theirs` is a way to automate the conflict resolution for a specific file based on the content of one branch while discarding the content of the other. It's essential to carefully consider which strategy to use based on your project's requirements and the nature of the conflict.**

`Sometimes, manual conflict resolution, where you selectively choose parts of both versions, is the most appropriate approach.`
