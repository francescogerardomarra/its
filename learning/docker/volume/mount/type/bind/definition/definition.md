# Bind Mounts Definition

- in Docker, a bind mount allows you to link a specific file or folder from your **host machine** directly **into a container**;
- it means whatever happens inside that folder (reading, writing, modifying) is immediately reflected both on your machine and inside the container;
- so it's like sharing a folder between your machine and the container.
