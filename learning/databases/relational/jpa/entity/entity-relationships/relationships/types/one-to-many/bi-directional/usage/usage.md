# Usage
This type of relationship is useful when you need to associate one entity with multiple instances of another entity, and both entities should be aware of each other, allowing navigation from either side of the relationship.

1. **when to use:**
    - a bi-directional one-to-many relationship is preferred when both entities need to be aware of the relationship, allowing navigation from both sides;
    - this is useful when you need to access the collection of related entities from the "one" side and the parent entity from the "many" side.

2. **example:**
    - a `Department` entity is associated with multiple `Employee` entities;
    - each department has many employees, and each employee belongs to one department;
    - the `Department` entity holds a reference to the collection of `Employee` entities, and each `Employee` holds a reference to the `Department`, allowing navigation from both sides of the relationship.
