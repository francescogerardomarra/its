# Docker Swarm Definition

An **orchestrator** is a tool that **automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking** of containers across multiple machines, in particular [Docker Swarm](../../../../../../orchestrator/docker-swarm/index.md):

- **container orchestration tool**: Docker Swarm is a native clustering and orchestration solution for managing multiple Docker containers across multiple hosts;
- **high availability**: it ensures fault tolerance by distributing services across different nodes, automatically recovering failed containers;
- **scaling and load balancing**: supports automatic scaling of containerized applications and provides built-in load balancing to distribute traffic efficiently;


- **service management**: allows declarative service definitions, ensuring that the desired number of replicas is always running in the cluster;
- **easy integration with Docker**: being a built-in feature of Docker, Swarm mode provides a straightforward setup and integration with Docker CLI and Compose.
