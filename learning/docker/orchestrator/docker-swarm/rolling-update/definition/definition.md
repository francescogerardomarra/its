# Rolling Updates Definition

- rolling updates in Docker Swarm allow you to update services **gradually**, minimizing downtime and ensuring application availability during deployment;
- a **rolling update** updates your service one task (container) at a time (or in small batches), instead of stopping all instances and starting new ones simultaneously;
- this helps maintain uptime and service continuity.
