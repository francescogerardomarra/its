# Driver Definition

- in Docker Compose, a volume driver specifies how the volume is created and managed by Docker;
- drivers enable integration with various storage backends, such as local disk storage, cloud storage, or third-party plugins;
- the default driver used is `local`, which stores volume data on the host file system;


- custom volume drivers allow more advanced functionalities, like storing data on networked storage systems or managing data across multiple hosts;
- to specify a driver in a Docker Compose file, use the `driver` keyword within the `volumes` section;
- some drivers may require additional configuration parameters, defined under the `driver_opts` key;


- using a specific volume driver can help in scenarios where data persistence, redundancy, or distributed storage are required.
