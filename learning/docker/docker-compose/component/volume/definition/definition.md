# Volumes Definition

- volumes in Docker Compose are used to persist data generated or used by Docker containers;
- they enable data sharing between the host machine and containers, or between multiple containers;
- volumes are defined within the `volumes` key in the `docker-compose.yml` file;


- they can be created and managed automatically by Docker or manually specified by the user;
- volume definitions can include options like read-only access and mounting subdirectories;
- using volumes helps maintain data even if the container is removed or recreated.
