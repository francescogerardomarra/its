# Why Use VM?

- **isolation and security:**
  - VMs operate independently from the host system and other VMs;
  - this isolation ensures that if a VM encounters issues (e.g., crashes, malware infections), it won’t affect the host or other VMs;
  - VMs are ideal for testing software or visiting potentially harmful websites, as you can experiment in a controlled environment without risking your primary system.
- **cost efficiency:**
  - multiple VMs can run on a single physical machine, reducing the need for additional hardware;
  - this consolidates resources and cuts down on costs for servers and maintenance.
- **platform independence:**
  - you can run multiple operating systems on a single device;
  - for example, you can use a Mac but still run Windows or Linux in a VM for specific applications that require those operating systems.


- **testing and development:**
  - developers use VMs to create isolated environments for testing new applications, configurations, or patches;
  - they allow you to test on different OS versions or setups without needing separate physical machines.
- **disaster recovery:**
  - VMs can be easily backed up, cloned, and restored;
  - if a system fails or data is lost, you can quickly recover by restoring a VM snapshot.
- **efficient resource utilization:**
  - by virtualizing underused physical servers, you maximize the usage of CPU, memory, and storage resources, reducing waste.


- **legacy software support:**
  - older software that isn’t compatible with modern systems can still run within a VM emulating the required legacy environment.
- **flexibility and scalability:**
  - VMs are highly flexible: you can allocate resources (CPU, RAM, storage) as needed;
  - they are scalable, especially in cloud environments, where you can easily add or reduce the number of VMs based on demand.
- **cloud computing:**
  - Cloud service providers use VMs to deliver scalable and customizable infrastructure to users;
  - if you're hosting a website or application on the cloud, it's likely running on a VM.


- **environment replication:**
  - you can replicate a specific environment to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production, reducing "it works on my machine" issues.
