# Types of VM

VMs are managed by a **hypervisor**, which is software or firmware that enables multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical machine.
- [Type 1 (Bare-Metal)](../type-one/type_one.md): runs directly on hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V);
- [Type 2 (Hosted)](../type-two/type_two.md): runs on a host operating system (e.g., VMware Workstation, VirtualBox).
