# What is a Pipeline

- a **pipeline** is a structured process used in software development, data processing, or automation, consisting of multiple stages and steps;
- **stages** are high-level phases of the pipeline that group related steps together, ensuring a logical flow and separation of concerns;
- **steps** are individual tasks or actions within a stage that perform specific operations, such as compiling code, running tests, or deploying artifacts;


- each **stage** can contain multiple steps that execute sequentially or in parallel, depending on the pipeline configuration;
- **conditions** and **dependencies** can be set between stages and steps to control execution flow based on success, failure, or specific triggers;
- pipelines often include **error handling** and **logging** mechanisms to track failures and optimize performance.
