# Key Features

- **multiple container management**: define and run multiple containers together in a single configuration;
- **YAML configuration**: uses a `docker-compose.yml` file to define services, networks, and volumes;
- **service orchestration**: handles dependencies, such as ensuring that a database starts before an application;


- **scaling**: easily scale services up or down using `docker-compose up --scale <service>=<number>`;
- **networking**: automatically sets up a network for the defined services;
- **persistent data with volumes**: allows containers to share or persist data using volumes.
