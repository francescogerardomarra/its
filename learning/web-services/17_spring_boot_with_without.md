# Using Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux With or Without Spring Boot: Considerations, Advantages, and Disadvantages

Spring Framework offers two primary modules for building web applications: Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) and Spring WebFlux. These modules can be used with or without Spring Boot, which is a framework designed to simplify the setup and development of Spring applications. This article examines the considerations, advantages, and disadvantages of using Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux with or without Spring Boot, along with their differences.

## Spring MVC With and Without Spring Boot

### What is Spring MVC?

Spring MVC is a traditional web framework based on the Model-View-Controller design pattern. It operates in a synchronous manner and uses the Servlet API.

### Using Spring MVC With Spring Boot

#### Considerations

- **Auto-Configuration:** Spring Boot auto-configures components, reducing boilerplate code.
- **Embedded Server:** Comes with an embedded servlet container (like Tomcat or Jetty).
- **Starter Dependencies:** Simplified dependency management using starter POMs.

#### Advantages

| Advantage             | Description                                                           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reduced Configuration | Minimal configuration needed due to auto-configuration.               |
| Quick Setup           | Faster setup and development cycle.                                   |
| Integrated Features   | Seamless integration with Spring ecosystem and third-party libraries. |

#### Disadvantages

| Disadvantage         | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Less Control         | Auto-configuration might not fit all specific needs.                        |
| Larger Footprint     | May include unnecessary dependencies if not customized.                     |

### Using Spring MVC Without Spring Boot

#### Considerations

- **Manual Configuration:** You need to configure DispatcherServlet, view resolvers, and other components manually.
- **Dependency Management:** Manual management of dependencies in `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.
- **Deployment:** Typically packaged as a WAR file and deployed to an external servlet container.

#### Advantages

| Advantage         | Description                                                                             |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Full Control      | Complete control over configuration and environment.                                    |
| Lightweight Setup | Only the necessary components are included, leading to a potentially smaller footprint. |

#### Disadvantages

| Disadvantage     | Description                                                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| More Boilerplate | More boilerplate code is required to set up the application.   |
| Complexity       | Higher complexity in managing dependencies and configurations. |

## Spring WebFlux With and Without Spring Boot

### What is Spring WebFlux?

Spring WebFlux is a reactive, non-blocking web framework introduced in Spring 5. It supports reactive streams and is designed for applications requiring high concurrency and asynchronous I/O.

### Using Spring WebFlux With Spring Boot

#### Considerations

- **Auto-Configuration:** Spring Boot handles the setup of components like WebHandler and RouterFunctions.
- **Embedded Server:** Comes with reactive servers like Netty pre-configured.
- **Reactive Starter:** Provides reactive starter dependencies.

#### Advantages

| Advantage                 | Description                                                       |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simplified Reactive Setup | Quick setup of a reactive environment with minimal configuration. |
| Reactive-Friendly         | Optimized for building reactive applications out of the box.      |

#### Disadvantages

| Disadvantage              | Description                                           |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Overhead                  | Some overhead due to auto-configuration.              |
| Less Fine-Grained Control | May include unnecessary components if not customized. |

### Using Spring WebFlux Without Spring Boot

#### Considerations

- **Manual Configuration:** You need to configure components like WebHandler, RouterFunctions, and codecs manually.
- **Dependency Management:** Manual inclusion of dependencies such as Reactor and Netty.
- **Deployment:** Can be packaged as a traditional WAR or as an executable JAR and run on Netty or other servers.

#### Advantages

| Advantage            | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Complete Control     | Full control over reactive components and configurations.                   |
| Minimal Footprint    | Only essential components are included, leading to a smaller footprint.     |

#### Disadvantages

| Disadvantage           | Description                                                             |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Steeper Learning Curve | Reactive programming is more complex and requires deeper understanding. |
| Manual Setup           | More manual setup and configuration, increasing the complexity.         |

## Differences Between Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux

| Feature                | Spring MVC (With/Without Boot)          | Spring WebFlux (With/Without Boot)        |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Programming Model      | Synchronous                             | Asynchronous and Reactive                 |

| Suitable For           | Traditional web applications            | Modern, high-throughput, reactive apps    |
| Learning Curve         | Easier for those familiar with servlets | Steeper due to reactive paradigm          |
| Performance Under Load | Thread-per-request, may block on I/O    | Non-blocking, better for high concurrency |
