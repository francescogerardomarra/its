# Definition
**Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) has the following characteristics:**
- it is a programming technique
  that enables developers to seamlessly integrate data
  between an object-oriented application and a relational
  database system;
- in essence, it bridges the gap between the
  object-oriented programming paradigm, where data
  is manipulated using objects, and the relational
  database model, where data is stored in tables
  with rows and columns;
- ORM frameworks provide a set of tools and
  libraries that automate the process of mapping
  data between the application's objects and the
  database tables;
- this includes handling tasks such as data querying,
  retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion, all
  while abstracting away the complexities of SQL
  (Structured Query Language) queries and database
  interactions;
- with ORM, developers can work with
  database entities as if they were regular
  objects in their programming language, without
  needing to directly deal with SQL queries or
  worry about low-level database interactions;
- this abstraction simplifies development,
  enhances code readability and maintainability,
  and speeds up the development process by
  reducing the amount of boilerplate code needed
  for database operations.
