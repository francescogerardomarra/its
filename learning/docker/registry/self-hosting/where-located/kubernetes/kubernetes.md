- **where:** 
  - deployed as a containerized service within a Kubernetes cluster.
- **why:**
  - simplifies deployment and management when the organization is already using Kubernetes;
  - allows the registry to leverage Kubernetes features like scaling, redundancy, and high availability.
- **example setup**:
