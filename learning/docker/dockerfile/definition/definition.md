# `Dockerfile` Definition

- a `Dockerfile` is a script that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image;
- it is essentially a blueprint for creating a containerized environment;
- the `Dockerfile` defines everything required to set up the image, such as the base image, application code, dependencies, environment variables, and commands to run within the container.
