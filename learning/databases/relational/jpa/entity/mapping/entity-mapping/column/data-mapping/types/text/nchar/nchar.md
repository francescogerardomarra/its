# `NCHAR`
**`NCHAR` has the following characteristics:**
- it is mapped to the `String` class;
- it is a **fixed-length unicode character string**;
- it always reserves the specified amount of space,
  padding with spaces if the stored string
  is shorter than the defined length;
- it is used when there is a need to store multilingual data or characters outside the ASCII range.
