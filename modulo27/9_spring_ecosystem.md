## 7. Spring Cloud

**Description:**
- Spring Cloud provides tools for building distributed systems and microservices.
- It offers features like service discovery, load balancing, and configuration management.

**Key Features:**
- Integration with service registries (e.g., Eureka, Consul).
- Circuit breakers (Hystrix, Resilience4j).
- Distributed tracing and monitoring.

**Use Case:**
- Building and managing cloud-native, microservices-based architectures.

## 8. Spring HATEOAS

**Description:**
- Spring HATEOAS simplifies the implementation of hypermedia-driven RESTful APIs by adding links and controls to API responses.

**Key Features:**
- Link creation and resource representation.
- Integration with Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux.

**Use Case:**
- Building RESTful APIs that follow the HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) principle.
