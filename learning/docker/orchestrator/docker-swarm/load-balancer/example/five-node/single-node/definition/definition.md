# Associate Only One Node With the Domain

- consider the [previous](../../all-node/definition/definition.md) example;
- in this chapter, we want to show the other case scenario:
  - **instead of mapping all the 5 nodes to the purchased domain, we map only one node to the domain**;


- **this is a bad practice, the good practice is illustrated within the [previous](../../all-node/definition/definition.md) example**.
