# Running
To test this application we can go ahead and simply follow the [testing guide](../../../../../../web-services/39_rest_hello_world.md) from our previous example.

This example is a fix to the [previous example's](../../../entity/entity-relationships/example/running/running.md) recursive nesting flaw.

After this fix the last testing query should no longer encounter the recursive nesting flaw.
