# Why does it matter?
Understanding ownership is important for handling cascading operations, ensuring that relationships
are maintained properly and that operations like deletions or updates donâ€™t break referential integrity.

**Cascading Deletes:**

- the "many" side, which holds the foreign key, controls cascading delete operations;
- if a `User` is deleted, the Order records associated with that user will also be deleted automatically
(via `ON DELETE CASCADE`);
- this ensures that no "orphaned" records (like orders that point to a non-existent user) are left in the database.

**Cascading Updates:**
- if a record in the "one" side (e.g., `User`) changes (e.g., the user's ID changes),
the "many" side (e.g., `Order`) typically needs to be updated as well;
- for instance, if a `User` changes their `user_id`, all the associated `Order` records
need to reflect the updated `user_id`;
- this update can be handled by the `ON UPDATE CASCADE` rule;
- cascading updates ensure that references to the modified record remain valid across related tables.

**Ownership in Cascading Operations:**
- the table that owns the relationship (i.e., the table that holds the foreign key)
typically controls the behavior of cascading operations like delete and update;
- for instance, in the example above, the `Order` table (the "many" side) will ensure
that all related orders are deleted when a `User` is deleted;
- similarly, if the User's `user_id` is updated, the `Order` records will also be updated.

## Examples of Cascading Actions Based on Ownership:
1. **Cascading Delete:**
   - **ownership**: the "many" side (in this case, the `Order` table);
   - **action**: if a `User` is deleted, all `Order` records linked to that user
   are deleted as well (via `ON DELETE CASCADE`).
   ```
   DELETE FROM shop_schema.User WHERE user_id = 1;
   -- All orders related to this user (user_id = 1) will be deleted automatically.
   ```
2. **Cascading Update:**
   - **ownership**: the "many" side (again, the `Order` table);
   - **action**: if a User's `user_id` changes, all `Order` records related to that
   user need to update their foreign key value accordingly (via `ON UPDATE CASCADE`).
   ```
   UPDATE shop_schema.User SET user_id = 2 WHERE user_id = 1;
   -- All orders with user_id_fk = 1 will now have user_id_fk = 2 automatically.
   ```
