# Isolation

- network isolation enhances security by keeping containers separated from each other, reducing the risk of unauthorized access;
- each Docker Compose service can be attached to a specific network, allowing fine-grained control over which services can communicate;
- by isolating networks, containers that do not need to communicate with each other remain completely inaccessible, minimizing potential attack vectors;


- network isolation prevents port conflicts between containers running on the same host by assigning unique internal network addresses;
- it facilitates better organization and management of microservices, as each network can represent a specific environment or service group.
