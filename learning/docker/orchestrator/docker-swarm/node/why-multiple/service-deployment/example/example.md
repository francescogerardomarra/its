# Example

- in this example, we want to update the image version (from `myapp:v1` to `myapp:v2`) of a service with 5 replicas:

    ```bash
    docker service update \
      --image myapp:v2 \
      --update-parallelism 2 \
      --update-delay 10s \
      my_service
    ```

- this will:
  1. **first batch (2 tasks updated)**:
     1. Swarm selects **2 tasks** to update first;
     2. these 2 containers are deregistered from the load balancer, they no longer receive traffic;
     3. new containers are started using `myapp:v2` to replace them;
     4. these new containers must **reach a running state** (**as soon as each task is in the "running" state, Swarm considers it successful regardless of healthcheck**);
     5. once each container is confirmed running, the new task is added to the service's [routing mesh](../../../../load-balancer/routing-mesh/how-work/how_work.md);
     6. the 2 old containers are **shut down** gracefully;
     7. only after the new containers are running successfully does the process continue;
     8. if the containers fail to reach the running state, the update process pauses and no further replicas are updated until the issue is resolved, either manually by someone or automatically if the tasks recover due to the serviceâ€™s restart policy.
  2. **delay**:
     - Swarm **waits 10 seconds** before proceeding to the next batch;
     - this delay allows time for monitoring, rollback if necessary, or manual intervention;
  3. **second batch of updates**:
     - the next **2 containers** will be replaced;
     - all points from 1 (**first batch**) to 2 (**delay**) are repeated;
  4. **final update**
     - the last **container** will be replaced;
     - all points from 1 (**first batch**) to 2 (**delay**) are repeated, **but just the last remaining container is selected to be replaced**.
