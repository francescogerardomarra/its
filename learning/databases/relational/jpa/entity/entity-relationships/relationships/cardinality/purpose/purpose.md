# Purpose
**Database Level:**
- **Enforce Referential Integrity:** ensures that relationships between records are valid (e.g., foreign key constraints);
- **Maintain Data Integrity:** ensures that the data adheres to defined rules (e.g., `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE` constraints);
- **Improve Performance:** optimizes data retrieval and joins using foreign keys and indexes;
- **Centralized Control:** enforces relationship rules across multiple applications or services accessing the database.

**Application Level:**
- **Abstraction:** maps database structures to higher-level objects for easier manipulation in code;
- **Business Logic Enforcement:** handles complex operations like cascading deletes or custom validation
that go beyond the database;
- **Ease of Development:** simplifies working with relationships through ORM frameworks (e.g., Entity Framework,
Hibernate);
- **Customizable Behavior:** offers flexibility for things like lazy/eager loading or custom filtering of
related entities;
- **Reduced Database Complexity:** reduces the complexity of the database schema by abstracting relationships
in the application;
- **Automatic Retrieval of Related Entities:** allows you to automatically retrieve related entities
(like parent/child or many-to-many relationships) when fetching an entity, depending on the application 
configuration (e.g., eager loading or lazy loading).



1. **Definition of cardinality (or multiplicity)**
   - **multiplicity**, also known as **cardinality**, specifies how many instances can participate in a relationship between entities.
   - common cardinalities include:
      - **one-to-one (1:1)**
      - **one-to-many (1:N)**
      - **many-to-one (N:1)**
      - **many-to-many (N:M)**
   - **example**: a single `Customer` can have many `Orders`, but each `Order` is associated with only one `Customer` (**one-to-many relationship**).

2. **In a Database-First model**
   - cardinality is **enforced at the database level**, using constraints such as:
      - **foreign keys** (`FOREIGN KEY`)
      - **uniqueness constraints** (`UNIQUE`)
      - **not null** and other structural rules.
   - this approach allows the database to **enforce referential integrity**:
      - for example, it prevents creating an `Order` without an associated `Customer`.
   - **example**: the presence of a foreign key ensures that each `Employee` must reference a valid `Department`.

3. **At the application level (e.g., with ORM)**
   - once relationships are defined in the database, they are **mapped to object models** using
   tools like ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping).
   - in a **one-to-many** relationship, the ORM:
      - automatically manages the join between related tables;
      - enables **transparent retrieval** of related data.
   - **example**: when querying a `Department` entity, the ORM can automatically load the list of associated `Employees`. This is done behind the scenes via a `JOIN`, but in the application itâ€™s accessed simply and directly (e.g., `department.employees` in code).
