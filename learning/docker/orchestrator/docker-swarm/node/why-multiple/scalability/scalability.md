# Scalability

- with multiple nodes, you can run more containers across machines;
- Swarm can distribute workloads efficiently so you donâ€™t overload one machine;
- you can scale services up/down across nodes as demand changes.

**Example:**

A web app with 100 replicas can be spread across 10 worker nodes, preventing any single machine from becoming a bottleneck.
