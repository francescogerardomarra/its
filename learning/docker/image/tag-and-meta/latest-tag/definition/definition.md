# `latest` Tag Definition

- **default tag**:
    - if you pull an image without specifying a tag, Docker assumes the `latest` tag by default;
    - typically used to designating the most recent version of an image in the repository to make it easier for others to pull the latest version without specifying a specific version tag;
    - for example:

      ```bash
      docker pull ubuntu
      ```
      
      is equivalent to:
  
      ```bash
      docker pull ubuntu:latest
      ```

- **image designation**:
    - the `latest` tag **does not necessarily mean the newest or most stable version**;
    - it simply points to a specific version of the image that the maintainer of the repository designates as `latest`.
- **maintainer control**:
    - the image maintainer decides which version of the image the `latest` tag refers to;
    - it could be the most recent version, the most stable version, or something else, depending on their tagging strategy.
 

- the `latest` tag is essentially a pointer (or alias) set by the **maintainer or admin of the Docker Hub repository** to point to a specific version of the image, such as `2.9.1`;
- it is entirely up to the image maintainer to decide which version the `latest` tag refers to.
