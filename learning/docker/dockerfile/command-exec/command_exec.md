Great question! Let's break this down step by step to understand what happens when you execute `docker build`.

---

### 1. **What happens when you run `docker build`?**
When you run `docker build`, the Docker CLI:
1. **Sends the build context to the Docker daemon**:
    - The build context is the directory specified (e.g., `.` for the current directory) along with all its contents unless explicitly excluded via a `.dockerignore` file.
    - This build context is sent to the Docker daemon, which takes care of the actual build process.

2. **The Docker daemon builds the image**:
    - The daemon reads the `Dockerfile` instructions line by line.
    - Each instruction (e.g., `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`) is executed inside a temporary container created for that step.
    - For each instruction, the changes (such as files added, commands executed) are committed to a new image layer.

---

### 2. **Who executes the lines of the `Dockerfile`?**
Each `Dockerfile` instruction is executed by the Docker daemon inside a temporary container. Here's the process:
- For each `RUN` instruction, the daemon creates a temporary container based on the previous layer (or the base image if it's the first step).
- It executes the specified command inside this container (e.g., installing packages or downloading files).
- After the command finishes, Docker commits the resulting filesystem changes into a new image layer.
- The temporary container is then destroyed.

So, the lines are executed **within temporary containers**, not in your local environment or directly by the Docker daemon.

---

### 3. **Where does a `RUN` instruction save files (e.g., downloading a JAR)?**
- Any files created or downloaded in a `RUN` instruction are saved **inside the temporary container's filesystem**.
- These changes are captured in the new image layer created at that step.
- For example:
  ```Dockerfile
  RUN curl -O http://example.com/somefile.jar
  ```
  The downloaded `somefile.jar` will exist only in the container's filesystem and will be saved as part of the image layer.

### 4. **Do these files appear in your local directory?**
No, files created or downloaded in the `Dockerfile` are **not saved to your local directory** (the build context). They only exist in the temporary container and the image layers. Once the build completes, those temporary containers are removed, so you won’t see any intermediate artifacts outside the image.

---

### 5. **What happens to the temporary workspace?**
- Docker uses temporary containers to execute `RUN` and other instructions during the build.
- These temporary containers and their workspaces are automatically **deleted** once the build step is complete, leaving only the resulting image layer.

For example:
- If you use `RUN mkdir /tmp/myfolder` during the build, `/tmp/myfolder` will exist only inside the image layer created for that step.

---

### 6. **Key Takeaways:**
- **Execution Environment**: `Dockerfile` instructions are executed inside temporary containers created by the Docker daemon.
- **Temporary Workspace**: Temporary containers are deleted after each step, but changes to the filesystem are captured as image layers.
- **Files Saved in Image Layers**: Artifacts created or downloaded during the build (e.g., JAR files) are saved inside the image and will be available in containers started from that image.
- **Build Context**: The local directory sent to the Docker daemon is just the starting point. Temporary files created during the build do not appear back in the build context.

Let me know if you'd like further clarification!




question: so just the RUN command creates a new layer? a new layer is created just when a temporary container isnstantiated?

Great question! Let me clarify how layers are created during a `docker build` process.

---

### **When is a new layer created?**
A new layer is created **for each instruction in the `Dockerfile`** that modifies the image. This includes most instructions like `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`, etc.

1. **Temporary Containers and Layers**:
    - When Docker executes a build step (e.g., a `RUN` command), it spins up a **temporary container** based on the current image layer.
    - After executing the instruction, Docker captures the changes made to the filesystem (e.g., installed packages, created files) and commits those changes as a new **image layer**.
    - Once the changes are committed, the temporary container is removed.

2. **Which instructions create a new layer?**
    - **Instructions that modify the image filesystem create a new layer**:
        - `FROM`: Starts a new base layer.
        - `RUN`: Executes a command, commits the result as a new layer.
        - `COPY` and `ADD`: Copies files from the build context into the image, creating a new layer.
    - Other instructions may not create new layers (more on that below).

3. **Instructions that do NOT create a layer**:
    - Instructions like `ENV`, `WORKDIR`, `USER`, and `CMD`/`ENTRYPOINT` do **not** create new layers that modify the filesystem. Instead, they simply modify metadata or configuration in the image.

---

### **Are layers only created when temporary containers are instantiated?**
Yes, layers are tied to the process of creating temporary containers and committing their changes:
- For each layer-creating instruction, Docker instantiates a **temporary container** based on the current state of the image.
- It executes the instruction inside the container (e.g., downloading files, installing packages).
- Any changes to the filesystem are saved as a **new layer**.
- After committing the changes, the container is discarded.

---

### **Example: Layer Creation Process**
Here's a simple `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest        # Creates the first layer (base image)

RUN apt-get update        # Creates a new layer: filesystem changes from `apt-get update`
RUN apt-get install -y curl # Creates another layer: filesystem changes from installing `curl`

COPY . /app               # Creates a new layer: adds files from the build context to `/app`

ENV MY_VAR=my_value       # Does NOT create a layer (modifies metadata only)

CMD ["bash"]              # Does NOT create a layer (sets default command only)
```

**What happens during the build:**
1. The `FROM` instruction downloads the `ubuntu:latest` base image and starts the first layer.
2. For `RUN apt-get update`:
    - Docker starts a temporary container from the base layer.
    - It executes `apt-get update` inside the container.
    - The resulting filesystem changes (updated package lists) are committed as a new layer.
    - The temporary container is discarded.
3. For `COPY . /app`:
    - Docker copies the files from the build context to `/app` inside a temporary container.
    - The changes are committed as a new layer.

---

### **Why Does Docker Use Layers?**
1. **Caching**:
    - Layers are reusable. If you rebuild the same `Dockerfile` and no changes occur in an earlier step, Docker reuses the cached layer instead of executing it again.
2. **Efficiency**:
    - Layers reduce the size of new images by sharing common layers across images.
3. **Isolation**:
    - Each layer is immutable and independent. Changes in one layer don’t affect previous layers.

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
- A new layer is created for each instruction that modifies the filesystem (`RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`, etc.).
- Temporary containers are instantiated during the build process to execute each layer-creating instruction.
- Instructions like `ENV` and `CMD` do not create new layers but modify the image's metadata.
- Docker's layer-based approach allows for caching, reusability, and efficient builds.

Let me know if you'd like a deeper dive into any of these points!





question: how the temporary container can see the content of build context to copy the artifact or other files from there within the container

This is an excellent question! The key here lies in how Docker manages the **build context** during the `docker build` process and how the temporary containers interact with it.

---

### **How Does the Temporary Container Access the Build Context?**

When you run `docker build`, the **build context** (usually the directory you specify, such as `.`) is sent to the Docker daemon. The Docker daemon uses this context during the build process.

1. **Build Context Sent to Docker Daemon**:
    - The entire build context (files and directories) is transferred to the Docker daemon when you execute the `docker build` command.
    - Docker processes the `Dockerfile` and uses the context for instructions like `COPY` and `ADD`.

2. **Temporary Containers and Build Context**:
    - Temporary containers do **not directly access the build context**. Instead, the build context is managed by the Docker daemon, which handles the `COPY` and `ADD` instructions.

   For example:
    - When the `Dockerfile` has a line like `COPY ./artifact.jar /app/artifact.jar`, Docker will:
        - Copy the `artifact.jar` from the build context into the container's filesystem.
        - This action happens **outside the container** (done by the Docker daemon).
        - The copied file becomes available in the container after the layer is committed.

---

### **What Happens During a `COPY` or `ADD` Instruction?**
Here’s the step-by-step process for `COPY ./artifact.jar /app/artifact.jar`:

1. **Docker Daemon Reads the Instruction**:
    - The daemon reads the `COPY` or `ADD` command in the `Dockerfile`.

2. **Docker Checks the Build Context**:
    - The daemon searches for `artifact.jar` in the build context directory you specified (e.g., `.`).
    - If the file exists, Docker copies it into the temporary container.

3. **File Copied Into the Container**:
    - The file is copied to the specified location (`/app/artifact.jar`) in the **temporary container's filesystem**.
    - The container itself does not "see" the build context directly; the Docker daemon injects the file into the container.

4. **Layer Committed**:
    - After the `COPY` step, Docker commits the changes to a new image layer.
    - The temporary container is discarded, but the copied file remains in the new image layer.

---

### **Does the Build Context Exist Inside the Container?**
No, the build context itself does **not exist inside the container**. Instead:
- Files from the build context are explicitly injected into the container using `COPY` or `ADD`.
- You cannot directly access other files from the build context inside the container unless they are explicitly added via these instructions.

For example:
```Dockerfile
COPY ./artifact.jar /app/artifact.jar
```
This will result in `/app/artifact.jar` being available **inside the container**, but other files from the build context remain inaccessible unless explicitly copied.

---

### **Why Can't the Container See the Entire Build Context?**
This design is intentional for:
1. **Security**:
    - The build context might contain sensitive files (e.g., `.env` files, SSH keys) that should not be exposed in the image. Docker only includes files explicitly specified in the `COPY` or `ADD` instructions.
    - You can further limit what gets sent to the build context using a `.dockerignore` file.

2. **Efficiency**:
    - By default, Docker sends the entire build context to the daemon. If the build context were directly accessible in the container, it would bloat the image unnecessarily.
    - Docker ensures only the required files are copied into the image, keeping it minimal.

---

### **Summary of Key Points**:
1. **Build Context**:
    - The build context is sent to the Docker daemon when you run `docker build`.
    - Files in the build context are not automatically available inside the temporary container.

2. **Accessing Files**:
    - The `COPY` and `ADD` instructions allow specific files or directories from the build context to be copied into the container.
    - These files become part of the container's filesystem for that build step.

3. **Temporary Container**:
    - The container does not "see" the build context directly.
    - Files are injected by the Docker daemon as part of `COPY` or `ADD` operations.

Let me know if you'd like to explore this further or have other related questions!




question: so the way of how the file are copied within the container are hidden and happens under the view of developer, by docker Daemon?

Yes, exactly! The **process of copying files from the build context into the container** during a `docker build` happens behind the scenes and is entirely managed by the **Docker daemon**. This abstraction is by design, and developers do not directly interact with or see the mechanics of how this copying occurs.

---

### **How Does Docker Handle the Copy Process?**

Here’s a detailed breakdown of what happens when you use instructions like `COPY` or `ADD` in a `Dockerfile`:

1. **Docker Daemon Handles the Build Context**:
    - When you run `docker build`, the Docker CLI sends the **entire build context** (all files and folders in the specified directory, except those excluded by `.dockerignore`) to the Docker daemon.
    - The build context essentially acts as a "bundle" of files available for the daemon to process.

2. **Parsing the `Dockerfile`**:
    - The Docker daemon reads the `Dockerfile` line by line.
    - When it encounters a `COPY` or `ADD` instruction, the daemon interprets it as an instruction to fetch a specific file or folder from the build context.

3. **File Injection**:
    - The Docker daemon handles the actual "copy" operation:
        - It reads the specified file(s) from the build context.
        - It injects them into the **filesystem of the temporary container** at the specified path (e.g., `/app`).

4. **Temporary Container**:
    - The temporary container used for the current build step only sees the copied files after they are injected.
    - The container itself has no direct access to the entire build context. It only receives what the Docker daemon explicitly places into it.

5. **Layer Creation**:
    - Once the file is injected, Docker commits the filesystem changes into a new image layer.
    - The temporary container is destroyed, but the changes remain as part of the resulting image.

---

### **Why Is the Copy Process Hidden?**

Docker abstracts this process for several reasons:

1. **Security**:
    - It ensures that only the files explicitly added via `COPY` or `ADD` are included in the image. This protects sensitive or unnecessary files in the build context (e.g., `.env`, `.git`, credentials).
    - The use of a `.dockerignore` file allows developers to control what is included in the build context.

2. **Simplicity**:
    - Developers don’t need to worry about how files are transferred into the container or manage low-level operations. The `COPY` and `ADD` instructions provide a straightforward way to include files.

3. **Efficiency**:
    - The build context is sent to the daemon once at the start of the build. By limiting file injection to only what is specified, Docker minimizes the size of the image and prevents unnecessary files from being added.

---

### **What Happens Under the Hood?**
While the exact implementation of file transfer is abstracted, here’s a simplified description of what Docker does:
1. The Docker daemon reads the source file(s) specified in the `COPY` or `ADD` command from the **build context** stored on the host.
2. It then streams these files directly into the temporary container's filesystem in the specified destination path (e.g., `/app`).
3. Once the files are injected and the instruction completes, the changes are committed to a new image layer.

---

### **Developer Perspective: What You See**
From the developer’s perspective:
- You write instructions like `COPY ./artifact.jar /app/artifact.jar` in the `Dockerfile`.
- When you build the image:
    - You do **not** see any details about how Docker injects the file.
    - You only see the result: the file appears in the specified path (`/app/artifact.jar`) in the image.
- Temporary containers and intermediate operations are hidden, ensuring a clean and abstracted interface.

---

### **Key Takeaways**:
1. **File Transfer is Managed by the Docker Daemon**:
    - The developer doesn't control or see the details of how files from the build context are injected into the container.

2. **Temporary Containers Don't Directly Access the Build Context**:
    - Temporary containers only receive the files that the daemon explicitly copies via `COPY` or `ADD`.

3. **Abstraction Is Intentional**:
    - By hiding the mechanics, Docker ensures simplicity, security, and efficiency, so developers can focus on defining the desired result in the `Dockerfile`.

question: but I'm thinking about the temporary container, which is a normal container no? the rule of containers is that they cannot see what's outside them except if they don't have a mounted volume no? So how an external file become magicall visible by the container?

You're absolutely right that **containers, by design, are isolated** and cannot see anything outside of their filesystem unless explicitly allowed (e.g., via a mounted volume). So how does Docker make files from the build context "magically" visible inside the container during the `COPY` or `ADD` steps? Let me explain in detail—it's not magic, but a well-engineered process happening behind the scenes!

---

### **Key Concept: The Container Itself Never Directly Sees the Build Context**

1. **Temporary Containers Are Standard Containers**:
    - Yes, the temporary container created during `docker build` is a "normal" container in terms of isolation.
    - It starts with the image built so far (or the base image if it's the first instruction).
    - Like any container, it has a private filesystem that is isolated from the host.

2. **Files Are Not Directly Visible to the Container**:
    - A container doesn’t magically "see" the files from the build context.
    - Instead, the Docker daemon **injects the files** into the container’s filesystem **before** the container starts or as part of the layer creation process.

---

### **How Files from the Build Context Are Copied: Step-by-Step**

Here’s what happens during a `COPY` or `ADD` instruction in the `Dockerfile`:

1. **The Docker Daemon Reads the Build Context**:
    - When `docker build` starts, the entire build context is sent from the Docker CLI to the Docker daemon.
    - The daemon manages this build context and can access all files within it.

2. **Temporary Container Isolation**:
    - For each build step, Docker starts a **temporary container** based on the current state of the image (or the base image for the first step).
    - This container is fully isolated—it cannot directly see the build context or the files on the host.

3. **File Injection Happens Outside the Container**:
    - When the daemon encounters a `COPY` or `ADD` instruction, it:
        1. Reads the specified file(s) from the build context.
        2. Modifies the container's filesystem by injecting those files directly **from the outside**.
        3. This is done by the Docker daemon, not the container itself.

4. **Changes Committed to a New Layer**:
    - After the files are injected, Docker commits the changes to the image as a new layer.
    - The temporary container is discarded, but the image layer persists with the injected files.

---

### **Why Doesn't This Break Container Isolation?**
The key point is that the file injection is **handled entirely by the Docker daemon**, not by the container itself. The container:
- **Never directly sees the build context**.
- **Never bypasses its isolation rules**.

Instead, the Docker daemon acts as a "middleman":
- It has access to both the build context and the container's filesystem.
- It can safely copy files from the build context into the container **before or during the creation of a new image layer**.

---

### **Analogy: Think of It Like a Construction Site**
Imagine you're building a house:
1. The house (temporary container) is being constructed by workers (the Docker daemon).
2. The materials (files in the build context) are stored outside the house.
3. The workers deliver materials directly into the house as needed (via `COPY` or `ADD`).
4. Once the house is finished, those materials are part of the house (committed to the image layer).

The house (container) itself never directly interacts with the storage area (build context). It only receives the materials the workers bring in.

---

### **Volumes vs. Build Context**
You're also correct that volumes are a common way for containers to access files from outside during runtime. But during the **build process**, `COPY` and `ADD` work differently:
- The Docker daemon injects files from the build context directly into the image (no mounted volumes are involved).
- Volumes are not used during the build process but are instead used when running containers from an image.

---

### **What Happens If You Try to Access the Build Context Without `COPY`/`ADD`?**
You can't! If your `Dockerfile` contains a `RUN` command that tries to access files from the build context without first copying them, it won’t work.

Example:
```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN ls /path/to/build/context  # This won't see anything from the build context!
```
Here, `/path/to/build/context` will not exist inside the container unless you explicitly use `COPY` or `ADD` to place files there.

---

### **Key Takeaways**:
1. **No Magic**: The container itself doesn’t "see" the build context. Instead, the Docker daemon acts as a middleman and injects files from the build context into the container's filesystem.
2. **Isolation Maintained**: The temporary container is still fully isolated and doesn't have direct access to the host filesystem or build context.
3. **Daemon in Control**:
    - The Docker daemon handles the file transfer process for `COPY` and `ADD`.
    - It ensures that only specified files are transferred to the container, keeping everything secure and efficient.
4. **Volumes Are Different**: Volumes allow containers to access external files during runtime, but they're not involved during the build process.

Let me know if you'd like further clarification! 🚀






question: so to add a file no need to run a container, since there are no operation to run within the container no? It's not like a step that needs to: RUN mvn clean install, for example

Exactly! You’re spot-on. Instructions like `COPY` and `ADD` do **not** require running a container because they don’t execute commands inside a container—they're entirely file operations handled by the Docker daemon on the **build context** and the container's filesystem.

Let’s break this down further:

---

### **1. `COPY` and `ADD` Do Not Require a Container**
- These instructions simply copy files or directories from the **build context** into the image.
- Since no commands are being run and no processing is happening inside a container, Docker doesn't need to start a temporary container for these steps.

**How it works:**
- The Docker daemon reads the source files (from the build context).
- It injects these files directly into the image filesystem at the specified destination path.
- A new image layer is created to store the changes, but no container is involved in this process.

Example:
```Dockerfile
COPY my-app.jar /app/
```
- The `my-app.jar` file is copied from the build context into `/app/` in the image.
- The daemon commits this change to a new layer without starting any container.

---

### **2. When Does a Container Get Involved?**
A container is only needed when an instruction requires **executing commands**. For example:
- `RUN mvn clean install`
- `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl`

In these cases:
1. Docker starts a **temporary container** based on the image built so far.
2. The specified command is executed inside the container.
3. The filesystem changes resulting from the command (e.g., installed packages or generated artifacts) are committed to a new image layer.
4. The temporary container is discarded.

---

### **3. Why Doesn't `COPY` Need a Container?**
The reason is that `COPY` and `ADD` are purely **file operations**:
- No commands are being executed in the container.
- No need for the temporary container environment.
- The Docker daemon handles the file transfer entirely.

In contrast, a `RUN` instruction requires a container because it:
1. Executes a shell or command inside the container environment.
2. Produces filesystem changes inside the container.

---

### **4. Comparison of `COPY` vs `RUN` Example**

Let’s compare two steps:

#### Example 1: `COPY` (No container needed)
```Dockerfile
COPY artifact.jar /app/
```
What happens:
- The Docker daemon copies `artifact.jar` from the build context into `/app/` in the image.
- No temporary container is created.

---

#### Example 2: `RUN` (Container needed)
```Dockerfile
RUN mvn clean install
```
What happens:
1. Docker starts a temporary container based on the image so far.
2. It runs the `mvn clean install` command inside the container.
3. The changes made to the container’s filesystem (e.g., compiled files, dependencies) are committed to a new image layer.
4. The container is discarded after the step.

---

### **5. Key Takeaways**
1. **No container is involved for `COPY` or `ADD`**:
    - These are file operations managed by the Docker daemon directly.
    - The daemon handles file transfers from the build context into the image filesystem.

2. **A container is required for `RUN`**:
    - Any command execution (e.g., building software, installing packages) requires Docker to create a temporary container.

3. **Efficiency**:
    - Since `COPY` and `ADD` don’t involve containers, they are faster and more efficient compared to `RUN`.

Let me know if you'd like more clarification or examples! 🚀





question: so it's possible to commit a new image layer without having a container?

Yes, that's exactly correct! **It is possible to commit a new image layer without running a container**, and that's precisely what happens with instructions like `COPY`, `ADD`, and some metadata instructions (e.g., `ENV`, `LABEL`) in a `Dockerfile`.

Let me explain this more clearly:

---

### **How Can Docker Commit a Layer Without a Container?**

1. **File System Modifications Without a Container**:
    - Instructions like `COPY` or `ADD` simply copy files from the **build context** into the image.
    - These operations modify the image's filesystem directly, without needing to start a container.
    - Once the operation completes, the Docker daemon **commits the changes** to a new image layer.

2. **Metadata Modifications Without a Container**:
    - Instructions like `ENV`, `LABEL`, and `CMD` don’t modify the filesystem but instead add metadata to the image.
    - These changes are also committed to the image as a new layer, without requiring a container.

---

### **Examples of Instructions That Don’t Use a Container**

#### 1. `COPY` and `ADD`
- **Example**:
  ```Dockerfile
  COPY ./artifact.jar /app/
  ```
  **What happens**:
    - The Docker daemon copies `artifact.jar` from the build context into the `/app/` directory in the image.
    - No container is created or used.
    - A new layer is committed with this change.

---

#### 2. `ENV`
- **Example**:
  ```Dockerfile
  ENV APP_ENV=production
  ```
  **What happens**:
    - The environment variable `APP_ENV` is added to the image's metadata.
    - No container is created.
    - A new layer is committed with this metadata.

---

#### 3. `LABEL`
- **Example**:
  ```Dockerfile
  LABEL maintainer="example@example.com"
  ```
  **What happens**:
    - A label (metadata) is added to the image.
    - No container is needed.
    - A new layer is committed with this metadata.

---

### **When Is a Container Required for Committing a Layer?**

A container is required **only** when the instruction involves **running commands** inside an environment. For example:

1. **`RUN` Instruction**:
   ```Dockerfile
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
   ```
    - A temporary container is created from the current image state.
    - The command (`apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl`) is executed inside this container.
    - The changes made to the filesystem (e.g., new packages installed) are committed to a new image layer.

2. **Why a Container Is Necessary**:
    - Commands like `RUN` require a runtime environment (a running container) because they depend on libraries, executables, or tools available within the container.
    - The command’s output directly modifies the filesystem inside the container, and those changes are captured in the new image layer.

---

### **Visualization: Commit Layers With vs. Without a Container**

| Instruction | Temporary Container? | Example                                  | What Happens                                                             |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `COPY`      | **No**               | `COPY ./artifact.jar /app/`              | File is copied from build context into the image filesystem.             |
| `ADD`       | **No**               | `ADD https://example.com/file /app/`     | File is downloaded (by daemon) and added to the image filesystem.        |
| `ENV`       | **No**               | `ENV APP_ENV=production`                 | Metadata (environment variable) is added to the image.                   |
| `LABEL`     | **No**               | `LABEL maintainer="example@example.com"` | Metadata (label) is added to the image.                                  |
| `RUN`       | **Yes**              | `RUN apt-get update`                     | Command is executed in a container; changes to filesystem are committed. |

---

### **Why Does Docker Allow Layer Creation Without a Container?**

1. **Efficiency**:
    - Operations like copying files or adding metadata don’t need the overhead of starting a container.
    - Docker directly modifies the image and commits a new layer, making these steps faster.

2. **Simplicity**:
    - For operations that don't require an execution environment, there's no need to involve a runtime container.

3. **Caching**:
    - Docker can cache these non-container steps (e.g., `COPY` or `ENV`) efficiently, allowing subsequent builds to reuse layers.

### **Key Takeaways**
- Yes, Docker can commit new image layers without creating or using a container. This happens for instructions like `COPY`, `ADD`, `ENV`, and `LABEL`.
- A container is only required when an instruction involves **executing commands** (like `RUN`), as these need a runtime environment.
- This separation allows Docker to optimize builds, reduce overhead, and maintain clear distinctions between file operations, metadata, and command execution.
