# Stack Definition

- a **stack** is a collection of interrelated services that work together to run an application;
- it is defined using a `docker-compose.yml` file, specifying multiple services, networks, and volumes;
- stacks ensure seamless communication between services through an internal Docker network;


- they help manage dependencies by allowing services to start in the correct order;
- shared volumes within a stack enable data persistence across container restarts;
- environment variables can be centrally managed to ensure consistent configuration across services;


- stacks can be deployed locally using Docker Compose or in a cluster using Docker Swarm;
- scaling is easier within a stack, as replicas can be defined for high availability and load balancing;
- centralized logging and monitoring simplify debugging and performance tracking;


- stacks are commonly used in microservices architectures, where different components like databases, APIs, and caches need to work together.
