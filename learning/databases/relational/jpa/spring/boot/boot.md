# SpringBoot
**Spring Boot has the following characteristics:**
- it is a framework that makes it easy to build and run Spring applications;
- it reduces the need for complex setup by [automatically configuring](../concepts/auto-config/auto_config.md) essential
components like database connections and [data sources](../concepts/datasource/datasource.md);
- this helps developers start quickly without writing a lot of extra code.
