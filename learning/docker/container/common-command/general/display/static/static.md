# Display Container Logs Static

- the following command is used to retrieve the logs generated by a specific Docker container;
- the logs printed by docker logs represent the **standard output (stdout)** and **standard error (stderr)** streams generated by processes running inside the specified Docker container;
- these logs are essentially what the application inside the container writes to its console:

    ```bash
    docker logs <container_name|container_id>
    ```

- executed command:

    ```bash
    docker logs 46fbfb5d5e8d
    ```

- output:

    ```bash
