# Delete Secret

- **deletes a specific secret:** this command removes the `my-secret` secret from the current Kubernetes namespace, making it unavailable to any pods or services using it;
- **irreversible action:** 
  - once deleted, the secret cannot be recovered unless it was backed up or recreated manually;
  - any pods depending on it may fail if they attempt to access the missing secret.

**Command to Delete the Secret:**

kubectl delete secret my-secret
```
