In JPA (Java Persistence API), entities are often related to each other through various
types of relationships such as one-to-many, many-to-one, or one-to-one. 

**In these relationships:**
- **Parent Entity:**
  - the parent entity is the entity that owns the relationship and holds a reference
  (either directly or indirectly) to one or more related entities;
  - the parent is responsible for managing the relationship and may define cascading operations
  (like persist, merge, remove, etc.).
- **Child Entity:**
  - the child entity is the one that is referenced by the parent;
  - it is the dependent entity in the relationship and may or may not have a reference to the parent entity;
  - for example, in a `@OneToMany` relationship, the "many" side (the child) may be the one that
  holds a reference to the parent entity.

In JPA, a fetch policy defines how related entities are retrieved from the database when the parent
entity is loaded.
It determines whether related entities are loaded immediately (eagerly) or on-demand (lazily)
when accessing the parent entity.

Fetch policies are particularly important in relationships such as `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, and `@OneToOne`,
where associations exist between entities. The fetch policy dictates whether the related child entities are 
loaded together with the parent entity or if they are only loaded when accessed explicitly in the 
application code.

It is important to note that fetch policies are designed at the application level. This is because the 
decision on how related entities should be fetched (lazily or eagerly) depends on how entities are 
referenced and managed in the application. The parent entity is the one that typically holds the 
references to the related child entities, and these relationships (direction, ownership, and cardinality)
are defined in the application code using JPA annotations such as `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, and `@OneToOne`.

This aspect of fetching entities is handled by the JPA provider (e.g., Hibernate) at the application
level and does not directly influence the database schema or queries generated by the database engine.
In contrast, database-level operations (such as cascade behaviors or foreign key constraints) are 
governed by the database schema and do not dictate how entities are retrieved in the application.
