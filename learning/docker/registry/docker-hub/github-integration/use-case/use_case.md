# Use Cases

* you want to automate the CI/CD process where every code push triggers a build and deployment pipeline;
* you need to ensure that your Java application is compiled, tested, and packaged consistently using GitLab CI runners;
* you want to containerize the final application artifact using a Dockerfile stored in the repository;


* you aim to distribute the resulting Docker image via Docker Hub for easy deployment across multiple environments;
* you require traceability and reproducibility of builds by linking Git commits to specific Docker image versions.
