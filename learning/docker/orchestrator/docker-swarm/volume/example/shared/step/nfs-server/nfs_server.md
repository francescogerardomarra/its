# Prepare NFS Server

An NFS (Network File System) server is a computer that stores files and makes them accessible over a network, so that other computers (clients) can read, write, and manage those files as if they were on their own local hard drives.

**Assume:**

- NFS server IP: `192.168.1.100`;
- exported path: `/mnt/shared_data`;
- the **exported path** of an NFS server is the directory on the server that is shared (or "exported") to clients over the network.
