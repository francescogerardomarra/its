# Why Use It

You should enable Swarm mode if:

- you want to simulate or manage a multi-host cluster;
- you're deploying containerized apps that need high availability;
- you want to use Docker-native orchestration instead of Kubernetes or third-party tools;


- you need a lightweight orchestration solution (simpler than Kubernetes).
