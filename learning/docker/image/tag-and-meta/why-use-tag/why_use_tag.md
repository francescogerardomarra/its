# Why Use Tags? 

- **version control**: tags allow you to maintain different versions of your application, making it easier to manage updates and rollbacks;
- **clarity**: by tagging images with meaningful names (like version numbers or release names), you can easily identify what each image contains;
- **best practices**: using tags helps in deploying the exact version you need, ensuring consistency across different environments (development, testing, production).
