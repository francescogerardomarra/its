# Why Use It

You'd build your own driver when:
- you have a custom storage system (like a company-wide NAS, SAN, Ceph, etc.);
- you want to enforce policies (encryption, quota, logging);
- you need fine-grained control over volume lifecycle (e.g., attach/detach logic);


- you want to integrate internal authentication or access controls.
