| Feature                   | Database-First                                         | Code-First                                             |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Starting Point**        | Database schema                                        | Application code and entity models                     |
| **Schema Control**        | Controlled manually in the database                    | Controlled via code and migrations                     |
| **Ideal For**             | Existing or legacy databases                           | New applications with domain-driven design             |
| **Tool Dependency**       | Requires DB design tools (e.g., SSMS, MySQL Workbench) | Requires ORM tools (e.g., Entity Framework, Hibernate) |
| **Model Synchronization** | Application code must adapt to DB changes              | Database updates are driven by code changes            |
| **Migration Handling**    | Manual or semi-automated                               | Automated via migration tools                          |
| **Collaboration Focus**   | DBA-centric workflows                                  | Developer-centric workflows                            |
| **Learning Curve**        | Easier for those familiar with SQL and DB design       | Easier for those with strong coding and OOP skills     |
