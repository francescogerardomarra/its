# Why Is It Used? 

- **privacy and security**:
    - avoid storing sensitive images (e.g., proprietary applications) on public servers;
    - ensure tighter control over who can access your images.

- **performance and speed**:
    - faster image pulls and pushes, especially for large images, when hosted on the same local network.

- **customization**:
    - tailor the registry's behavior, such as authentication and logging, to meet specific requirements.


- **cost savings**:
    - avoid data transfer and storage costs associated with cloud-based registries.
