# `CascadeType.ALL`
**In Java, `CascadeType.ALL` has the following characteristics:**
- it applies all cascade types (`PERSIST`, `MERGE`, `REMOVE`, `REFRESH`, and `DETACH`);
- it ensures that all persistence operations on the parent entity are applied to the associated entities;
- it simplifies configurations when you want to propagate all possible operations to related entities in an object graph.
