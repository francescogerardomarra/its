# Obtain a SSL/TLS Certificate

- acquire a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (e.g., Let's Encrypt) or generate a self-signed certificate for internal or private use;
- the certificate is used to establish a secure HTTPS connection between the Docker client and the Docker registry;
- it's part of the TLS handshake process that facilitates the encryption of communication.
