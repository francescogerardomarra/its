# Why does it matter?
Understanding ownership is important for handling cascading operations, ensuring that relationships
are maintained properly and that operations like deletions or updates donâ€™t break referential integrity.

Cascading Deletes:

- the "many" side, which holds the foreign key, controls cascading delete operations.
- if a User is deleted, the Order records associated with that user will also be deleted automatically (via ON DELETE CASCADE).
- this ensures that no "orphaned" records (like orders that point to a non-existent user) are left in the database.

Cascading Updates:
- if a record in the "one" side (e.g., User) changes (e.g., the user's ID changes), the "many" side (e.g., Order) typically needs to be updated as well.
- for instance, if a User changes their user_id, all the associated Order records need to reflect the updated user_id. This update can be handled by the ON UPDATE CASCADE rule.
- cascading updates ensure that references to the modified record remain valid across related tables.

Ownership in Cascading Operations:
- the table that owns the relationship (i.e., the table that holds the foreign key) typically controls the behavior of cascading operations like delete and update.
- for instance, in the example above, the Order table (the "many" side) will ensure that all related orders are deleted when a User is deleted. Similarly, if the User's user_id is updated, the Order records will also be updated.
