# Definition
**The code-first approach has the following characteristics:**
- it is a methodology used 
  in the building of applications 
  that interact with databases;
- it involves writing the application code 
  and data models first, then generating 
  the database schema from those models;
- this approach contrasts with the [database-first approach](../../database-first/definition/definition.md), 
  where the database schema is created first, 
  and the application code is generated to match it;
- **it is commonly used** in scenarios 
  **where developers want more control over the domain model** 
  and prefer to evolve the database schema from within the application code;
- **it requires strong programming skills**, particularly in **object-oriented design** 
  and the use of **ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers)**, 
  such as **Entity Framework**, **Hibernate**, or others, 
  to manage the mapping between code and database schema.
