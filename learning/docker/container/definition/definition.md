# Container Definition

- a container is a lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the application code, runtime, libraries, dependencies, and configuration files;
- containers are designed to run consistently across various environments, from development and testing to production;
- containers characteristics:
  - **self-contained**: each container has everything it needs to function with no reliance on any pre-installed dependencies on the host machine;
  - **isolated**: since containers are run in isolation, they have minimal influence on the host and other containers, increasing the security of your applications;
  - **independent**: each container is independently managed, deleting one container won't affect any others;
  - **portable**: containers can run anywhere, the container that runs on your development machine will work the same way in a data center or anywhere in the cloud.
