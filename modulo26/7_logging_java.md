# How to Use This Index
Each of the topics listed above builds a foundational understanding of logging in plain Java, which is crucial for when you move to Spring Boot. If you’re unfamiliar with any of the subtopics, start with those, as they provide the necessary knowledge to fully grasp Spring Boot’s logging capabilities.

# What Happens on Top of Logging in Plain Java When Using Spring Boot?

When considering logging in **Spring Boot**, several enhancements and abstractions are added on top of plain Java logging. These additions simplify logging configuration and provide more powerful features for developers. Below are the key differences and improvements:

---

## 1. **Logging Abstraction with SLF4J**

- **Plain Java**: Uses `java.util.logging` (JUL) or frameworks like Log4j, Logback directly.
- **Spring Boot**: Uses **SLF4J** (`org.slf4j.Logger`) as the unified logging API, which abstracts the underlying logging framework. This allows you to swap the logging framework easily (e.g.  between Logback, Log4j2, or JUL) without changing the code.

  - Example:
    ```java
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass.class);
    ```

---

## 2. **Logback as Default Backend**

- **Plain Java**: You need to manually configure and set up a logging framework (e.g.  Log4j, Logback).
- **Spring Boot**: By default, Spring Boot uses **Logback** as the logging backend for SLF4J.

  - **Logback** offers advanced features like asynchronous logging, automatic log rotation, and configurable log levels.
  - Spring Boot auto-configures Logback with sensible defaults, which means no additional setup is needed unless custom configuration is desired.

---

## 3. **Auto-Configuration of Logging**

- **Plain Java**: Requires manual configuration of handlers, formatters, and log levels.
- **Spring Boot**: Automatically configures logging:
  - Console and file logging are enabled by default.
  - Log levels are set automatically based on profiles (e.g.  `application.properties` or `application.yml`).
  - Supports runtime adjustments using Spring Boot Actuator.

  Example of configuring log levels in `application.properties`:
    ```properties
    logging.level.root=INFO
    logging.level.com.example=DEBUG
    ```

---

## 4. **Profile-Specific Logging Configuration**

- **Plain Java**: No built-in concept of profiles.
- **Spring Boot**: Supports **profile-specific logging configurations**. This allows you to have different logging setups based on the environment (e.g.  `dev`, `prod`).
  - Profile-specific files: `logback-spring.xml` or `application-{profile}.properties`
  - Log levels, file locations, and appenders can vary across environments.

  Example:
    ```properties
    logging.level.com.example=DEBUG # In dev profile
    logging.level.com.example=INFO  # In prod profile
    ```

---

## 5. **Enhanced Logging Features (Colorized Output, Pretty Console Logs)**

- **Plain Java**: Logs are usually plain text, and you need to manually configure colorization.
- **Spring Boot**: Logs in the console are **colorized by default** (ANSI colors) for better readability in supported terminals. This is especially useful for development.

---

## 6. **Spring Boot Actuator for Runtime Log Level Changes**

- **Plain Java**: Static log levels are defined during application startup and require code changes for modification.
- **Spring Boot**: Allows you to **change log levels dynamically** at runtime using Spring Boot Actuator's `/actuator/loggers` endpoint or via JMX.

  Example to change log level at runtime via HTTP:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST localhost:8080/actuator/loggers/com.example.myapp -d '{"configuredLevel": "DEBUG"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    ```

---

## 7. **Integration with Other Frameworks**

- **Plain Java**: You need to manually set up bridges for other logging frameworks (e.g.  `java.util.logging`, `Commons Logging`, etc.).
- **Spring Boot**: Automatically bridges other logging frameworks to **SLF4J**, so any existing logging libraries (like `java.util.logging`, `Log4j`, etc.) will work seamlessly with SLF4J and Logback without needing additional configuration.

  - It can bridge JUL (Java Util Logging) and `commons-logging` to SLF4J automatically.

---

## 8. **Simplified External Configuration**

- **Plain Java**: Requires manual setup for different logging configurations in external files like `logback.xml`, `log4j2.xml`, etc.
- **Spring Boot**: Supports **externalized configuration** for logging through files like `logback-spring.xml`, `log4j2-spring.xml`, or `application.properties`. You can even use Spring profiles to load different logging configurations based on the active profile.

  Example of `logback-spring.xml`:
    ```xml
    <configuration>
        <appender name="CONSOLE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
            <encoder>
                <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - %msg%n</pattern>
            </encoder>
        </appender>
        
        <root level="INFO">
            <appender-ref ref="CONSOLE"/>
        </root>
    </configuration>
    ```

---

## 9. **Default Logging Setup for Spring Components**

- **Plain Java**: You need to manually log different parts of your application, including Spring components.
- **Spring Boot**: Spring Boot automatically configures logging for key components such as:
  - Embedded web server (e.g.  Tomcat, Jetty)
  - Bean initialization and lifecycle events
  - Auto-configuration reports
  - Spring Data/JPA logs

  Example:
  - Spring Boot logs web server startup events, bean lifecycle events, etc., without any configuration.

---

## 10. **Customizing Logging Output Format**

- **Plain Java**: You need to configure handlers and formatters to customize output.
- **Spring Boot**: Allows easy customization of the log output format through properties or external configuration files like `logback-spring.xml`.

  Example in `application.properties` to set custom log patterns:
    ```properties
    logging.pattern.console=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - %msg%n
    logging.pattern.file=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - %msg%n
    ```
