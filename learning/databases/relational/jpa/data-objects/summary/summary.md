| **Data Objects** | A general term for objects that represent or hold data in an application.                     | Represents data structures across different layers of an app.   | - Encompasses POJOs, Entities, DTOs, and VOs.<br> - Store data for business logic, persistence, and communication between layers.       | - Structuring data across layers (business, persistence, UI).                                                                 |
| **POJO**         | A simple Java object without framework dependencies or annotations.                           | To represent basic data in a minimalistic way.                  | - Plain Java class.<br> - No annotations, behavior, or dependencies.<br> - Focuses purely on data representation.                       | - Simple data structures without persistence concerns.                                                                        |
| **Entity**       | A POJO mapped to a database table via ORM (e.g., JPA).                                        | To persist and retrieve data from a database.                   | - Annotated with `@Entity`.<br> - Must have a primary key (`@Id`).<br> - Tied to database records and persistence logic.                | - **Exchanged between `@Service` and `@Repository` layers.**<br> - Representing database records for CRUD operations.         |
| **DTO**          | A simple object used to transfer data between layers or across networks.                      | To decouple internal models from external data representations. | - Contains only data (no behavior or business logic).<br> - Often used for specific data sets to minimize exposure of internal details. | - **Exchanged between `@Controller` and `@Service` layers.**<br> - Transferring data between service layers or API responses. |
| **VO**           | A domain object that represents a value or concept, typically immutable and without identity. | To represent meaningful, immutable values in the domain model.  | - Immutable and conceptually related attributes.<br> - No unique identity (not tied to database rows).                                  | - Representing business concepts like money, addresses.                                                                       |
