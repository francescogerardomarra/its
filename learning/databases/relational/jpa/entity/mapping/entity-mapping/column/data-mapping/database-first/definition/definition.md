# Definition
**The database-first approach has the following characteristics:**
- it is a methodology used 
in the building of applications 
that interact with databases;
- it involves creating and designing
the database schema first, then generating 
or writing the application code to interact
with that schema;
- this approach contrasts with the [code-first approach](../../code-first/definition/definition.md),
where the application code is written
first, and the database schema is generated from
the code;
- **it is commonly used** in scenarios
**where the database already exists** or 
needs to be designed meticulously
before the application development;
- **it requires strong database skills**, particularly in **using DDL (Data Definition Language)**,
such as **CREATE TABLE**, **CREATE INDEX**, and other related commands, to structure
and manage the database schema effectively.
