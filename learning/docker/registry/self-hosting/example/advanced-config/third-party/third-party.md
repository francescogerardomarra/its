# Third-Party Tools

- instead of setting up and managing a basic self-hosted Docker registry, you can use third-party tools like **Portus** or **Harbor**;
- which provide a more user-friendly web interface along with additional features;
- **additional features**:
  - **role-based access control (RBAC)**: 
    - implement granular permissions to ensure secure access and management of container images;
    - Harbor, for instance, supports user roles and project-level permissions.
  - **tag and vulnerability scanning**: leverage features provided by tools like Harbor to scan images for vulnerabilities and tag them for easy version tracking and deployment management;
  - **replication and backup**: set up replication between multiple registries to improve reliability and availability, and configure backup policies to ensure the safety of your images in case of system failure.
