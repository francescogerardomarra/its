# Docker Images

- **image layers:**
    - Docker images consist of layers;
    - each layer represents a set of filesystem changes (like adding files or installing software);
    - these layers are stored in the registry.
- **tags:**
    - tags are used to identify different versions of an image;
    - for example, an image might have tags like `latest`, `v1.0`, or `v2.1`.
