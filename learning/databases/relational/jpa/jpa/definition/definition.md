# Definition
**JPA (Java Persistence API) has the following characteristics:**
- it is a **specification**, meaning it defines a standard way to map Java objects to database tables but does not provide an implementation.
- it consists of **a collection of interfaces, rules, annotations, and query language (JPQL)**
that ORM frameworks must follow.
- it was introduced as part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform in version 5;
- **it needs to be implemented by a JPA
    implementation to be utilized
    (e.g. [Hibernate](../../orm/hibernate/hibernate.md)).**
