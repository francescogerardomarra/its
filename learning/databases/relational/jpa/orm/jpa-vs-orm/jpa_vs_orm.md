# JPA vs ORM
- JPA is a specification for ORM in Java, defining the rules and guidelines for 
mapping objects to relational databases.
- ORM refers to the broader concept and implementation of mapping
Java objects to relational database tables, and JPA is one of the most
popular ways to implement this concept in Java.

So, when comparing JPA vs ORM, JPA is a standardized way to implement ORM in Java,
and ORM is the overall practice of mapping objects to databases.
