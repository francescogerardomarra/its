# Persistence
**Persistence** means saving data so it doesn’t disappear when the application stops running. Without persistence, any data your program creates would be lost when you close it.  

To keep data for later use, Java applications store it in databases. There are two main types:  
- **Relational databases** (e.g., `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`) store data in tables, like a spreadsheet.  
- **NoSQL databases** (e.g., `MongoDB`, `Redis`) store data in a more flexible way, like a big document or a key-value pair.  

Persistence is important because it allows applications to remember information, like user accounts, settings, or past actions, even after they’re closed. Without it, every time you restart the app, it would be like starting from scratch.
