# Developer Localhost

- **where:**
  - a developerâ€™s local machine.

- **why:**
  - useful for simulating real-world workflows by practicing the push/pull process;
  - enables testing of CI/CD pipelines locally without needing an external registry:
    - in case you have a testing pipeline in local, this allows the **local** pipeline to push and pull images entirely within the local environment;
    - speeding up builds, avoiding cloud dependencies, and enabling offline workflows.
  - allows easy reuse of images across isolated environments (e.g., Docker Compose projects, local Kubernetes clusters) on the same machine;
  - limited to local access unless explicitly exposed (not recommended for production).

- **example setup:**
  - a developer working on a microservices project locally pushes a new backend image to `localhost:5000` and uses it in multiple isolated environments (e.g., a different Docker Compose project or a local Kubernetes cluster) for integration testing.
