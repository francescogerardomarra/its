# Use Cases

**You should prefer this approach when:**
- you want full control over the build process, including custom build steps, testing, and security checks;
- your organization already relies on GitLab CI/CD for automation and wants a centralized pipeline for building, testing, and deploying;
- you need to integrate additional steps, such as unit tests, security scans, or signing the artifact before pushing the image;


- you want to build and push images conditionally, e.g., only when tests pass or based on specific branches or tags;
- you require integration with other GitLab features, such as environments, deployments, and approvals.

**When not to use it?**
- if you want a simple, straightforward image build process without managing GitLab CI/CD configuration;
- if you donâ€™t want to handle authentication between GitLab and Docker Hub manually.

### When to Choose **Case 2 (Docker Hub Webhook)**
**You should prefer this approach when:**
- you want Docker Hub to automatically handle image builds whenever thereâ€™s a code change;
- you donâ€™t need additional build steps like testing, security scans, or pre-processing before the Docker image is created;
- you want a simple setup without managing GitLab CI/CD pipelines;
- your workflow is more Docker-centric, and your team is comfortable managing images directly from Docker Hub;
- you want to offload build processes to Docker Hubâ€™s infrastructure rather than GitLab runners.

**When not to use it?**
- if you need fine-grained control over the build process, such as running tests before packaging the application;
- if your team relies heavily on GitLab's CI/CD workflows for consistency across different projects.

---

### **Final Decision**
- **If you need a highly configurable build process with tests, security scans, and deployment logic, go with GitLab CI/CD (Case 1).**
- **If you just need a simple and automatic image build process without extra complexity, go with Docker Hub Webhooks (Case 2).**

Ah, I see what you're aiming for! You want **GitLab CI/CD to handle the artifact generation** (e.g., compiling the Maven project) but **let Docker Hub handle only the image build** based on the updated artifact.

### **Is this possible?**
Yes, but Docker Hubâ€™s default automated builds usually pull the latest **code** from a repository, not external artifacts. However, you can configure it in a way that Docker Hub builds the image **from a pre-built artifact instead of rebuilding the code**.

---

### **How to Set It Up?**
#### **1. GitLab CI/CD pipeline does the following:**
- Compiles the Maven project and generates the artifact (e.g., `.jar` file).
- Pushes the compiled artifact to a shared storage location accessible by Docker Hub, such as:
    - An **artifact repository** (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory, or GitLab Package Registry).
    - A **cloud storage service** (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
- Sends a request (HTTP webhook or API call) to **notify Docker Hub** that a new artifact is available.

#### **2. Docker Hub automated build does the following:**
- Uses a `Dockerfile` that does **not rebuild the application** but instead:
    - Downloads the **pre-compiled artifact** from the shared storage.
    - Copies the artifact into the image.
    - Builds and pushes the image to Docker Hub.

---

### **Does This Make Sense?**
âœ… **Yes, in these cases:**
- You want **GitLab CI/CD to handle the build** but **Docker Hub to handle the image** instead of pushing from GitLab.
- You need **Docker Hub to maintain control over image builds** for security, compliance, or visibility.
- Your **GitLab CI/CD runners have limited resources** and you want to offload image building to Docker Hub.
- Your **Docker Hub repository is public**, and you want automated builds to be triggered without exposing credentials from GitLab.

ðŸš« **No, if:**
- You **already have the Docker image built in GitLab CI/CD**, in which case it's more efficient to just **push it directly from GitLab** to Docker Hub instead of triggering Docker Hub to build again.
- You donâ€™t have a good place to store the compiled artifact **where Docker Hub can access it**.

---

### **Alternative Approach (More Common)**
If you still want GitLab to handle everything **but keep Docker Hub updated**, a more efficient approach would be:
1. **GitLab CI/CD builds both the artifact and the Docker image** in the pipeline.
2. **GitLab CI/CD pushes the image directly to Docker Hub** (instead of triggering a rebuild).
3. **Docker Hub simply hosts the image**, without rebuilding it.

This is **the most common approach** because it avoids unnecessary rebuilds and provides full control over the pipeline.

Would you like an example GitLab CI/CD configuration for either approach? ðŸš€
