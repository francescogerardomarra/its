# Set Where Run (`--constraint`) Definition

- the `--constraint` option is used when deploying services in Docker Swarm to control where a service runs, based on node labels;
- this is useful when you want a service to run only on specific nodes that meet certain criteria, like hardware type, availability zone, or any custom label you've assigned.
