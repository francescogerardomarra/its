## POJO (Plain Old Java Object)
- a POJO is a simple Java class that does not depend on external frameworks;
- it contains attributes and their respective getter/setter methods;
- it is used for representing data in a structured way but does not enforce any specific behavior;
- POJOs are typically used for basic data modeling or passing data between different
layers when no persistence is involved.

POJOs can be simple, data-only objects, and are not tied to any database.
They may or may not have annotations.

**POJOs:** represent simple, non-framework dependent data structures.
