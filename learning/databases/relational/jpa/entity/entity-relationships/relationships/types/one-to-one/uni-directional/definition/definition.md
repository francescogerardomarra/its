# Definition
**A uni-directional relationship has the following characteristics:**
- one entity has a reference to another, but the 
referenced entity does not have any knowledge 
of the referencing entity;
- in the context of a one-to-one relationship, 
this means that only one entity holds the reference
to the other.
