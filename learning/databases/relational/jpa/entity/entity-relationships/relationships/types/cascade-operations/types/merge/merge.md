# `CascadeType.MERGE`
**In Java, `CascadeType.MERGE` has the following characteristics:**
- it propagates the `merge` operation from the parent entity to associated entities;
- it updates both the parent and its associated entities, ensuring that changes made to the parent are also reflected in related entities;
- it is essential for updating an object graph, keeping both the parent and child entities in sync with the database.
