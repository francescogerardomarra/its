# `docker compose up -d`

- this command is the same of previous [docker compose up](../compose-up/compose_up.md) command, **but runs in detached mode**;
- meaning the containers will run in the background;
- without `-d`, the logs from the containers would be shown in your terminal, and the terminal would stay "attached" to them.
