# Why do merge conflicts happen in Git?

**They typically happen when two different branches have made conflicting changes to the same part of a file** or when the branches have diverged in such a way that Git cannot determine which changes should take precedence.

Conflicts generally arise when two people have changed the same lines in a file, or if one developer deleted a file while another developer was modifying it.
