# Differences

- docker compose is designed for managing multi-container applications on a single host; 
- orchestrators like Docker Swarm and Kubernetes manage containerized applications across multiple hosts in a cluster;
- docker compose lacks built-in features for high availability, self-healing, and dynamic scaling; 


- orchestrators provide these capabilities to ensure resilience and automatic recovery;
- docker compose is simpler to set up and use, making it ideal for development and small-scale applications; 
- orchestrators are more complex but offer advanced networking, service discovery, and load balancing for large-scale deployments.
