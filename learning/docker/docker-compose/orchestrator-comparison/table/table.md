| **Feature**         | **Docker Compose**                                                                                    | **orchestrators (Docker Swarm & Kubernetes)**                                                  |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | focuses on defining and running multi-container applications on a single host.                        | designed for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts in a cluster.           |
| **Configuration**   | uses a simple YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`) to define services, networks, and volumes.             | uses declarative configurations (`docker stack deploy` for Swarm, manifests for Kubernetes).   |
| **Scalability**     | does not provide built-in high availability or automatic scaling.                                     | supports dynamic scaling of services based on demand.                                          |
| **Self-healing**    | - does not handle self-healing; <br> - requires manual intervention or external solutions.            | - provides self-healing capabilities; <br> - failed containers are restarted automatically.    |
| **Networking**      | lacks advanced networking and service discovery mechanisms.                                           | offers built-in service discovery, load balancing, and networking between services.            |
| **Rolling updates** | does not support rolling updates natively.                                                            | enables rolling updates and rollbacks for seamless application deployment.                     |
| **Complexity**      | - easier to set up and use; <br> - best suited for development, testing, and small-scale deployments. | - more complex setup, especially for Kubernetes; <br> - Swarm is easier but less feature-rich. |
| **Adoption**        | widely used for local development environments.                                                       | Kubernetes is the industry standard for large-scale container orchestration.                   |
