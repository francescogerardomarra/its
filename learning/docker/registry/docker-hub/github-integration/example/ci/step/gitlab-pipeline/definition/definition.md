# GitLab Pipeline Definition

- the `gitlab-ci.yml` file defines the pipeline configuration for GitLab CI/CD, specifying the steps, stages, and scripts needed to automate building, testing, and deploying code;
- it must be placed in the root directory of the project for GitLab CI/CD to automatically detect and execute the pipeline;
- an explanation of the `gitlab-ci.yml` file is provided in the next chapters.
