# Definition of conflict markers

`Conflict markers are special annotations that version control systems, like Git, insert into code files when there's a conflict during a merge operation.`

Here's a breakdown of the common conflict markers you might encounter:

- `<<<<<<< HEAD`: This marker indicates the beginning of the conflicting changes from the current branch or commit, often referred to as the "HEAD."

- `=======`: This is a separator line that distinguishes your changes from the changes made by someone else in another branch or commit.

- `>>>>>>> [Commit or Branch ID]`: This marker signifies the end of the conflicting changes from the other branch or commit, identified by the specific commit or branch ID.
