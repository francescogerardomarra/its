# Prerequisites

- **install Docker**: 
  - make sure Docker is installed on your system;
  - you can verify by running:

      ```java
      docker --version
      ```

- **Docker Hub account (optional)**: if the image you need is hosted on Docker Hub or another registry, you may need an account to pull it, especially for private images.
