# Why Both Exist

- Docker Compose exists because it provides a simple and fast way to define and run multi-container applications without the complexity of a full orchestration system; 
- for development, testing, and small-scale deployments, it is often more efficient and easier to use;
- Kubernetes, while more powerful, requires significant setup, resources, and expertise to manage, which can be overkill for small applications; 


- using docker compose allows developers to avoid unnecessary complexity when orchestration is not needed;
- many applications start small and may never need the scalability and resilience of Kubernetes; 
- for those that do, transitioning from Docker compose to Kubernetes is possible, but using Kubernetes from the beginning may introduce unnecessary operational overhead.
