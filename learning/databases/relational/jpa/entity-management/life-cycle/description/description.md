# Description
The Entity Life Cycle describes the different states an entity object can be in as it is managed
(or not) by JPA through the `EntityManager` and the persistence context.

Each entity moves through specific states during its "lifetime" â€” from creation to deletion.

There are four states and you can find an explanation for each of them [here](../states/states.md).
