# Kubernetes Definition

- in this example, we are going to create a secret within Kubernetes;
- **Kubernetes** is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications;
- a `.jar` program, will retrieve the secret and print it to console output;


- the `.jar` file will be containerized and run within a Kubernetes pod;
- a **Pod** in Kubernetes is the smallest deployable unit that runs one or more containers together on the same node, sharing networking, storage, and configuration;
- it can contain a single container or multiple tightly coupled containers that work together, such as a main application and supporting sidecar containers.
