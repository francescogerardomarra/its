# Why Use It

- **security**: for running sensitive or untrusted code where you want to eliminate the possibility of any external communication;
- **testing**: to test behavior when the network is unavailable or to ensure that code doesn't rely on network access;
- **minimal resource usage**: if networking is unnecessary, this removes overhead;


- **specialized containers**: some containers only need to work with mounted volumes (e.g., data processors or migration tools), not the network.
