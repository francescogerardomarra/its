# What Is Docker

- Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, and manage applications in a lightweight, portable container environment;
- these containers bundle an application and its dependencies together, ensuring that the application runs consistently across various computing environments, such as development, testing, and production.

**Key Features of Docker:**
- **containerization**: containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages of software that include everything needed to run an application-code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings;
- **portability**: since containers encapsulate all dependencies, they can run consistently across different environments, such as your laptop, a cloud server, or a production machine;
- **efficiency**: containers share the host system's kernel, making them faster and more resource-efficient than traditional virtual machines;


- **isolation**: each container runs in its isolated environment, ensuring that applications do not interfere with each other;
- **scalability**: Docker makes it easy to scale applications by running multiple containers or orchestrating them using tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
