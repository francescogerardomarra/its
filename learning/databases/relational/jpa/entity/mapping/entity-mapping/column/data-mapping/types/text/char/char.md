# `CHAR`
**`CHAR` has the following characteristics:**
- it is mapped to the `String` class because `CHAR` is
not a single character, but a **fixed-length character string**;
- it always reserves the specified amount of space,
padding with spaces if the stored string
is shorter than the defined length;
- it uses the default character set of the database, which can be ASCII,
ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1), or any other character set configured in the database;
- it is used for storing strings with 
a fixed length, such as codes or abbreviations.
- **this data type is supported by these technologies:**
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - SQL Server
