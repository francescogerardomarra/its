# Disadvantages
- **limited control over generated schema**:
    - the ORM might not produce an optimal or  
      expected database structure without careful configuration.
- **migration complexity**:
    - managing and applying database migrations  
      can become complex in larger projects.
- **tight coupling to code**:
    - the database structure is tightly bound to the codebase,  
      making collaboration with DBAs or external tools more challenging.
