# What is the `HEAD` in Git when dealing with merge conflicts?

```java
<<<<<<< HEAD
// code from the current branch
=======
// code from the incoming branch
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

In this example, **HEAD represents the code from the current branch**, and branch-name represents the code from the branch being merged in. The ======= line separates the conflicting changes.

So, "HEAD" is a reference to the latest commit on your current branch and serves as a point of reference when resolving merge conflicts. It represents your branch's state before the merge, and you need to decide how to incorporate the changes from the incoming branch into it to resolve the conflict.
