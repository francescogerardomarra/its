# Prerequisites

- it's not possible to run this example locally, since you need 2 different machines (nodes);
- **this example is not a good practice since**: 
  - the manager nodes run the workloads (containers).
- we implemented this example just to show that manager nodes can also run containers;


- **remember to not use this architecture in production**;
- **you can find a good architecture example with worker nodes that run workloads and manager nodes that just manage the swarm cluster [here](../../../example/step/step.md)**.
