# What is a merge conflict in Git?

**A merge conflict is a situation in version control where conflicting changes to the same part of a file occur in different branches,** making it challenging for the system to automatically reconcile and merge the changes.

Merge conflicts typically arise in collaborative software development environments where multiple contributors are working on the same project simultaneously.

A merge conflict in Git occurs when you attempt to merge two branches, and Git is unable to automatically resolve the differences between the two branches' code.
