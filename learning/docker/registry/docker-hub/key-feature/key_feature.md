# Key Features

- **public and private repositories:**
  - **public repositories**: free to use and accessible to everyone;
  - **private repositories**: allow users to store images that only authorized users can access.

- **official images:**
   - Docker Hub hosts **official images** maintained by Docker and its partners, such as `nginx`, `redis`, and `mysql`;
   - these are thoroughly tested and provide a reliable starting point for various use cases.

- **automated builds:**
   - automatically build Docker images from code repositories (e.g., GitHub or Bitbucket) whenever changes are pushed.


- **image tagging:**
   - supports tagging different versions of images, making it easy to manage updates and versions of an application.

- **search and discovery:**
   - users can search for images uploaded by the community, enabling easy reuse of containerized applications and tools.

- **webhooks**
   - integrates with other CI/CD tools to trigger actions (e.g., deployments) when an image is updated.
