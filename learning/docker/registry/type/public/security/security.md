# Security

- limited control over security, though public registries like Docker Hub provide automated vulnerability scanning for images;
- their primary goal is to make images easily accessible to the community;
- while public registries do offer **basic security features** (e.g., vulnerability scanning, multi-factor authentication), they prioritize usability and openness;


- security features are often behind a paywall and lack the customizability available in private registries;
- public registries are not designed to integrate with an organizationâ€™s internal security systems like LDAP or SSO;
- this makes them less suited for environments where strict user access management is essential.
