# Branch

In a version control system, such as Git, **a branch represents a separate line of development that diverges from the main branch** (usually called "master" or "main"). Creating a branch allows developers to work on new features or bug fixes without directly affecting the code in the main branch. Once the changes in the branch are tested and deemed stable, they can be merged into the main branch to integrate the changes into the application.
