# Stop a Running Container

- the following command stops a running container by sending a termination signal, allowing for graceful shutdown:

   ```bash
   docker stop <container_name|container_id>
   ```

  - this command **sends a `SIGTERM` signal** to the main process inside the container, giving it a chance to shut down cleanly;
  - if the process does not stop within a default timeout (usually 10 seconds), Docker then sends a `SIGKILL` to forcefully terminate it.

- executed command:

    ```bash
    docker stop dc1fc7b84b53
    ```

- output:

    ```bash
    dc1fc7b84b53
    ```

- list running containers:
