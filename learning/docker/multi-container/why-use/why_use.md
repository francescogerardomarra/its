# Why Use It

- **separation of concerns**: each container does one thing well (e.g., one for web server, one for database);
- **scalability**: you can scale individual services (e.g., scale only the web server if traffic increases);
- **maintainability**: easier to update or replace individual services without affecting the rest of the app;


- **reusability**: same container image can be used in multiple projects.
