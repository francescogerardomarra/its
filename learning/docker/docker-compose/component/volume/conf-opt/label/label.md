# Labels

- labels in Docker Compose are key-value pairs used for metadata associated with a volume;
- they are specified under the `volumes` section in the `docker-compose.yml` file;
- labels allow you to add descriptive information or identify volumes based on certain criteria;


- they can be used for organizing or grouping volumes, or for automation purposes;
- each volume in the `volumes` section can have one or more labels;
- labels are commonly used to work with orchestration tools or in integration with other services that support labels;


- the syntax for defining labels is `labels: key=value`;
- you can access the labels at runtime to apply specific logic or filtering in other tools or systems;
- labels are not required, but they help in managing and distinguishing volumes in complex Docker environments.

**Example:**

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    image: my-app-image
    volumes:
      - my_data:/data

volumes:
  my_data:
    labels:
      project: my_project
      environment: production
      backup: "true"
```
