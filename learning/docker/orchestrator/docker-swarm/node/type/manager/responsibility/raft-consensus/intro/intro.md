# Introduction

- manager nodes use the Raft consensus algorithm to maintain consistency;
- only one manager is the **leader** at any time, others are followers;
- changes (like deploying a service) are only made if a majority agrees (quorum).











Absolutely — this is the perfect way to understand *why* Raft is needed by comparing two cases: **with Raft** vs. **without Raft**.

Let’s simulate a simple Docker Swarm cluster with **3 manager nodes**:

* Node A
* Node B
* Node C

We’ll walk through what happens when a **client sends an update** (e.g., deploy a service), once **with Raft**, and once **without Raft**.

## ✅ **With Raft (Correct Behavior)**

### 📦 Scenario:

1. Node A is the **leader**.
2. A client sends a command: “Deploy Service X”.
3. Node A:

    * Appends the command to its **Raft log**.
    * Sends the log entry to Nodes B and C.
4. Nodes B and C **acknowledge** (majority: 2 out of 3).
5. Node A **commits** the entry and applies it to the swarm state.
6. **All 3 nodes are consistent.**

### 🧠 If Node A Fails Now?

* B or C can become the new leader.
* The committed change (Service X deployed) is in their logs.
* They continue with the **correct state**.

✔️ **No data loss. No inconsistency. Cluster recovers cleanly.**

## ❌ **Without Raft (Naive Implementation)**

### 🚨 Scenario:

1. Node A is the **leader**.
2. Client sends “Deploy Service X”.
3. Node A **directly applies** the change to its local swarm state — but **does not replicate it**.
4. Before it can tell Nodes B and C, **Node A crashes**.

Now:

* Nodes B and C **never saw the command**.
* A **new leader is elected**, say Node B.
* Node B has **no knowledge** of Service X.
* From the system’s point of view: **Service X never existed.**

### ❗ Consequences:

* Service X is **lost**, even though the client got a “Success” response from the original leader.
* If Service X had sensitive data, it may be **partially deployed on A**, causing a **split-brain** issue.
* Cluster state is **inconsistent**, unrecoverable without external intervention.

| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Commit requires majority? | ✅ Yes                   | ❌ No                        |
| Data loss on failure?     | ❌ No                    | ✅ Possible                  |
| Safe leader election?     | ✅ Guarantees up-to-date | ❌ Might elect outdated node |
| Consistency guaranteed?   | ✅ Always                | ❌ No                        |
| Complexity                | 😐 Higher               | 😀 Simpler, but unsafe      |

## 🧩 Final Insight

**Distributed consensus is hard.**

Without Raft (or an equivalent algorithm), you might:

* Think your system is simpler.
* But you’ll suffer from **data loss, inconsistencies, and failures that are very hard to debug**.

Raft **forces coordination** to guarantee that:

* Only one node acts as leader.
* Changes are never “committed” unless they’re **safely stored across a majority**.
* Cluster recovers from failure **without data corruption**.
