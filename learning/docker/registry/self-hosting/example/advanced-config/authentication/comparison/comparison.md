| **Purpose**                   | secures communication by encrypting data in transit.                                                                                                                              | authenticates users by requiring credentials (username/password).                                                             |
| **Primary function**          | provides confidentiality and integrity of data.                                                                                                                                   | provides access control to the registry.                                                                                      |
| **Type of protection**        | protects data transfer (e.g., images, manifests).                                                                                                                                 | prevents unauthorized access to the registry.                                                                                 |
| **How it works**              | uses SSL/TLS certificates to establish an encrypted connection, most commonly over HTTPS, but also supports other protocols like FTPS, SMTP, and more, depending on the use case. | uses an `Authorization` header to send Base64-encoded credentials (username and password) as part of HTTP requests.           |
| **Vulnerability if alone**    | does not restrict access to authenticated users.                                                                                                                                  | credentials are exposed if transmitted over an unencrypted connection.                                                        |
| **Typical use case**          | ensures secure transport of sensitive data over the network.                                                                                                                      | ensures only authorized users can push/pull images.                                                                           |
| **Configuration**             | requires an SSL/TLS certificate (self-signed or from a CA).                                                                                                                       | requires a username/password combination stored within the server.                                                            |
| **Strengths**                 | - encrypts all data in transit, including credentials;<br>- prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.                                                                                   | - simple to set up;<br>- adds a basic level of access control.                                                                |
| **Weaknesses**                | - does not control who accesses the registry;<br>- requires certificate management.                                                                                               | - weak on its own without TLS (credentials can be intercepted);<br>- not as secure as token-based authentication (e.g., JWT). |
| **Real-world usage together** | commonly combined with Basic Authentication to secure both communication and access control.                                                                                      | often used alongside TLS to avoid exposing credentials in plaintext.                                                          |
| **Alternatives**              | not typically replaced (TLS is essential for encryption).                                                                                                                         | token-based authentication (e.g., JWT), client certificates, or LDAP/SSO integration.                                         |
| **Best practice**             | always use TLS to secure communication between the client and the registry.                                                                                                       | use alongside TLS for added protection of credentials and access control.                                                     |
