# What it is
**Spring Boot has the following characteristics:**
- it is a framework that makes it easy to build and run Spring applications;
- it reduces the need for complex setup by [automatically configuring](../auto-config/auto_config.md) essential
components like database connections and [data sources](../datasource/datasource.md);
- it follows the convention over configuration paradigm, meaning it provides sensible default settings
to minimize the need for manual setup;
- this helps developers start quickly without writing a lot of extra code.
