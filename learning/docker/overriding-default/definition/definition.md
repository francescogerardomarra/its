# Overriding Container Defaults Definition

- when you create a Docker container from an image, that image comes with default settings;
- like what command to run when the container starts, environment variables, ports, volumes, etc.
- overriding container defaults means you’re changing some of those default settings when you start the container;
 

- you’re saying: “Hey Docker, I know the image says to do X, but I want to do Y instead”.
