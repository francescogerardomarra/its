# What Is a Docker Image Tag?

- a **tag** is an optional part of the image name and is typically formatted as `repository:tag`;
- the default tag is `latest` if you do not specify one;
- the tag helps differentiate between versions of the same image;
 

- for example, you might have:
    - `myapp:1.0`
    - `myapp:1.1`
    - `myapp:latest`
