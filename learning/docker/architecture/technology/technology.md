# Underlying Technologies

- **namespaces**:
    - provides isolation (processes, network, file systems) for containers.
- **control groups (cgroups)**:
    - limits resource usage (CPU, memory) for containers.
- **union file systems**:
    - layers multiple file systems for efficient storage and distribution of images.


- **container runtime**:
    - uses tools like [containerd and runc] for low-level container management.
