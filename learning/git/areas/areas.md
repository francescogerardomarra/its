# The three main areas

In Git, there are three main areas that relate to the lifecycle of changes to files:

1. **Working Directory**: This is where you modify, add, or delete files. Changes made in the working directory are not tracked by Git until you explicitly add them to the staging area.

2. **Staging Area (Index)**: This is an intermediate area where you prepare changes before committing them. Files that you want to include in the next commit are added to the staging area using the `git add` command. This area lets you review and selectively stage specific changes, rather than committing everything in the working directory.

3. **Repository (HEAD)**: Once changes are staged, they can be committed to the Git repository. The commit creates a snapshot of the changes in the staging area and stores it in the repository, creating a new commit object with a unique identifier (hash). The HEAD points to the latest commit in the branch, representing the current state of the project.

So, files move from the working directory to the staging area when you use `git add` to stage them, and then from the staging area to the repository when you `git commit` to commit them. This workflow allows for controlled and organized tracking of changes in Git.
