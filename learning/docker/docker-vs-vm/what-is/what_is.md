# What is a VM (Virtual Machine)?

- a **VM** (Virtual Machine) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer;
- it allows you to run an operating system (OS) and applications in a virtualized environment, isolated from the underlying hardware.

**Key Features of a VM:**

- **virtualization**: a VM uses virtualization technology to mimic the hardware resources of a physical computer, including the CPU, memory, storage, and network interfaces;
- **isolation**: each VM operates independently, meaning multiple VMs can run on the same physical hardware without interfering with each other;
- **guest OS**: a VM can run its own operating system, referred to as the **guest OS**, which may differ from the host system's OS.
