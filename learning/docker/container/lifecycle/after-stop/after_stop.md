# After Stop

1. **container state**: 
   - once stopped, the container is no longer running but is still retained in Docker's storage;
   - its state is marked as "exited";
   - you can check the status of all containers (including exited ones) with:

      ```bash
      docker ps -a
      ```

2. **accessing logs**: 
   - you can view the logs of the container to see the output generated by your program;
   - the following command retrieves the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) logs produced by the processes running inside the container;
   - this includes application logs, debugging output, or any messages printed by the processes.

      ```bash
      docker logs my-running-app
      ```

3. **removing the container**: if you no longer need the container, you can remove it using:

   ```bash
   docker rm my-running-app
   ```

4. **restarting the container**: 
   - if you want to run the container again, you can do so with the same command;
   - however, note that if the container is already stopped, you'll need to either remove it or use the `--rm` option when running it to automatically remove it after it stops;
   - **re-run a stopped container, will execute it from the previous state, so if the program is finished it will not re-execute the `CMD` command again**.
